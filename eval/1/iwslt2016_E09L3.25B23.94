When I was 11, I was born one morning from the sounds of the skier.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy what was rather unusual at the time, because he was mostly mad.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what it meant, but my father obviously made me very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
That morning I'll never forget.
A real school.
The Taliban were taking the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned girls to go to school.
And so I was committing for five years as a boy and I was beaten by my older sister who was not allowed to be on a secret school.
And so we could go to school for both of them.
Every day, we took another way, so nobody could guess where to go.
We were sitting in our blog bags so it looked like we were going to buy a shopping store.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of a fool, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew we were risked by our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and every day, the class had to fall out for a week, because the Taliban had been beating.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and daughters were valued.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he was on his daughter, my mother -- to send to school, and was thrown away from his father.
My mother was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family ever received an education.
It was always clear that his children would get an education, even though the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk to send his kids to school.
I remember that in the years, I was so frustrated in the Taliban sometimes, and I was so frustrated by our lives, from the constant fear and the perspective.
I thought that I had a good joke, I had to give back, but my father said, "Tin-daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be thrown out of your house in war.
But one thing that you're going to stay with is what's in here. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to give me still?"
I'm 22 years old now.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed in the war for decades.
Less than six percent of my older women have a higher degree than the Sekar, and if my family didn't have been using so much to my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today as a proudly in the middle of the Kansas House College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was released from his family, because he was paying his daughters to go to school, one of the first who was advising me.
He's not just with my graduate degree, but also, I was the first woman who runs him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
That's why I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start with the Hubble, the first Internet, and maybe the only board for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school table is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to experience with great ambition, all of them want to perceive their chances.
And to see how their parents and fathers are facing them, as well as my parents, despite all the conflicting.
As Ahmed, who is not really his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and they're dead through a bomb on the side of the road, just a few minutes away.
And when he arrived at home, the phone rings, and a voice would beat him, if he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
And he said, "Tall me now, if you want me, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter's daughter's desk because of your old, and pre-exquence."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that's often prevented in the West: the majority of us, the success, is a father who sees the value of his daughter and realizes that their success is also success.
That's not to say that our mothers don't have a role in our success.
They're often more likely to be more accurate and compelling in the future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely unaware.
And the Taliban just went to school a few hundred-and-half girls, because it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls, the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to look at America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long, and the way to the United States population is changing.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are willing to engage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is one country for me, and the hope, and the unconcessable possibility, and I remember the girl, the SOLA.
Just as I have, they have big dreams.
Thank you very much.
All I do, including profession, my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, 1977 -- I see young, but it's not -- I have -- in Sambia, Kenya, I work in the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to projects with Africa's technical collaboration.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I think, 21 years, thought that we're brilliant people, and we're very successful in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we started to do.
So our first project, which was inspired by my first book called "Ripples" at Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias, how to grow food.
We came to the local European seeds in Southeast, in this crazy valley, which leads to Sambesi's Flord, and we trained to the local population of the Japanese and tomato sauce and ...
Of course, the local people had absolutely no interest, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came to work.
And we were amazed that there was no such a waste in the valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God, we're here!"
"Mugter at time to save the people of Sambias before the star."
Of course, mindieh, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-social tomatos. In Italy, they became so big, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, just as agriculture is."
When the tomato bubble was dated and red, about 200 pesuits came from the river and around.
We said to the Sambique: "Oh God, the nilperper!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so brilliant in Italy, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French did, what the French did, and after I saw what they did, I was proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the nourber.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've never given to the outside African.
You should read the book "Dead Aid Aid" from Dambuba Moyo, she's a CCian economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We have a trillion trillion dollars in the last 50 years in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was doing.
Just read your book.
Think about a African woman who we've been doing.
We are Western people, imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, and we're going to hypwey them, or we're patriarchical.
Both of these words come from the Latin root, which means "father" means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I'm going to treat every other culture than they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I'm going to put on another culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "birra, boss."
I was once more excited when I read the book "Sally Beauty" by the singing. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, they leave you alone.
That's the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
And this conference tomorrow, who opened up, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocololic colonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I created a system called business fund, where never is being reacted, and you become the local property of the local talent, the local man who have the trauma to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get into a community with ideas, you sit with the local community.
We're not working from offices.
We meet in cafeteria. We meet ourselves in Kubip.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to close with friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like it, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in human history.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case, why instead of going to a community and telling people what to do, why don't we listen to them? Not in the community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have been part, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they want to see.
So, planning is a little bit of a stick.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working on one to do that, to do this, have to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the home doctor of the company, the hospital of the business that sits in your house, in your kitchen table, and in the cafeteria, helps you find the means to transform your passion in a way to live.
I tried this infinance, West Australia.
I graduated to the time, and I tried to avoid the disbelief, where we say other things to do.
And so I went through the streets in the first year and had my first three days of my first clients. I helped him, he was a farmer in a garage, he was Maorori, and I helped him to go to a restaurant in a restaurant in a restaurant, and then the fishermen came up and said, "You know, you'd help the Maor?" Can you help us?"
I helped these five fish, and I was working together and not selling this wonderful tuna in a factory in Albany for 60 cents perway, but to Japan for 21 dollars of Sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them?" Can you help us?"
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I'm holding the mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's stop it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be over loneliness.
So, Peter printer, one of the best business companies in history, died with 96 years ago.
So Peter's printer was philosophy professor before he was working on companies. Peter Cameron said, "Cake is really unconquivable with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So planning is the death cup of entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, not knowing what the smartest human being wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to one.
You have to offer them arguments and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they will get more and more.
In a community of 10,000 people, we're going to get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 thousand people, the intelligence and passion?
What's the presentation you've ever liked for today?
"Hear, passionate people. You've got that. You've got it clapping.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-filling fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn engine is not sustainable.
The free-sense species is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, we can build and transfer them with them.
The technologies don't exist for this.
Who's going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Are you kidding!
The government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're already doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a pre-oartistic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of the city in New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and they were speculated, and they were phoded in the city in 100 years, and the conclusion was, the city was a myth: New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? You looked at the curve and said, if the population grew at this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to be able to get them to the people, and it's impossible to get them done with six million horses.
Because they went out of crap.
1860 of them see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea to find another technology had made the race. There were little tiny factories in the back of the country.
And Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be offered to them with discomion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of them have to do is to run three things: to sell the product, the market capital, the capitalist, has to be massive.
You guess what?
We never met a single person who's going to produce something that can be used at the same time, sell and save money.
That's not what it's like.
That person was never born.
We've been doing research and we've looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wingleshouse, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been, just one, no one, was created by one person.
Now we teach 16 year-old graduates in North Ireland, and we start to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransian Autographic, and the task is 16 to the first two pages of Richard Bransian Autographian Autograph, how often he uses the word "the" and how often "the the word "not."
"I'm," and 32 times per second.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody started a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator has a small entrepreneur in cafeteria and Bars, and the partnery buds that they're going to do for someone who's done this gentleman who speaks about this E.<unk>s speaking to you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting the organization of leadership, to help them find the means of the means of the means and people, and we've found that the miracles of the local population, that culture and the economy can be transformed only by the passion, the energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it has to be, to be in Alice's miracles.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to try to engage in communication.
I was scared.
That's true. Fear before these students with their large brains and their large books and their large, I don't trust me.
But as the conversation evolved, it took me to see how Alice was going down to the sunshineon and a door to a whole new world.
And I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed by the idea that they had, and I wanted to find that other miracles.
I think to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We need to really need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the biggest problems, like energy and environmental and health, and when we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, we're not going to move forward, and I think that it's in our responsibility as non-profutantionalists, to look at these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please, please, please.
So I want to show you some of the approaches that you can do, we can see that science and technology that you're busy with, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, well, what?
Let's tell us why this science area is so relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that their feathers are looking at us, but also tells us that their feathers, the gluteny structure in our bones, are based on them, because they're important to understand and treat blindness.
And when you describe what you do, then you're preventable dictionaries.
Now, these arguments are a obstacle to understanding your thoughts.
Now, surely you could use your "pit and time" and yet, why don't you just say "space and time," what much more understand us?
We're trying to make sense of understanding, not just the same as you're going to turn your level down.
As Einstein said, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without having to deal with compromise.
So a few things are about this: examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can pull us into your deer.
And when you present your work, you take the dots away.
Have you ever asked why it's called point-off.
What happens when someone is looking at? Another one is just weeks, and with these points, your audience.
So a slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the conversation about the work-making part of our brain, and that's how we're really going to get excited about it.
This example, the result of Geneber Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the special structure of the drive is so robust that it actually was the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffelel.
Now the trick here is to use a single, simple sentence that is going to be present to the audience once it's going to lose the thread, it's using images and graphs that are also creating our other senses, and then creates a deeper understanding of what they describe.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up these towers and see the wonders of science and technology.
And the engineers that I've taught, I've taught myself to make the "The Bottom" in my tight contact, I want to sum up all the way with an equation.
Look at your science points and your writing, you divide that through the popular, so the audience is important, and you multiply the whole thing you have with your passion, and you can see that it's extraordinary, and you can make new interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I really like to feel very much.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can actually film a crime in the human race.
You can start a message with a cell phone and launch a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a video with a cell phone, and you can take a song, and you can get it up in the soundscoud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
And you can see, as hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and showed up.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're imagining that all of these people who were coming out and they were asking change, a cell phone in the bag.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep up.
Hold it up. Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost every single one of them today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how my life changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines full of information.
Pell data.
And why is this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, E.U. is a direct line.
This line of law is called the bankship movement.
And this line is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in the entire Europe, has to store a range of users's information.
Who is going to call? Who's going to send an email?
Who is sending a text?
And when you use a cell phone, where you're.
All of this information is stored at least six months, to two years from your phone company or your Internet phone.
And all over Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want to be."
They said, we don't want to be able to use this trade supply.
We want self-replication in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet service to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to be."
And here you can see, like tens of thousands of people in the streets of Berlin and said, "Take fear instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be on the edge of the line of the line of 2.0
The Stasi was the headpatchini in Eastern Grawnland.
And I also wonder, is that it really works?
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the telegraph, who was the biggest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send all the information that you've stored me.
And I asked her once, and she said, "I didn't get a right answer. Just a half-eaning blue."
But then I told myself, I want to have this information, because it's my life, it's overflow.
So I decided to put a court trial on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the <unk>Ph. telegraph said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to go back to the counter to which they were sending me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court decided that the introduction of E.U.R. was based on the German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown, brown pipe with a CD.
And on the CD, this is what it was.
35830 lines of information.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge date. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
That's six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you can see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make her write.
Because I want to show people what's called the state-fovering supply.
So with time and open data town, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, you can track.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt to the train to C<unk>l<unk>nn, and how many calls I walk.
And all of this is possible by this information.
That makes you a little bit scared.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I call my wife and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then a few friends call me each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you the one, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other's time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leader of the group.
And when you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
And when you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design, as you can monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who's talking to who's talking to someone who's sending an email, all of this is possible, if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months, in Europe to 28.
As I said at the beginning, we'd imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, phones in their bag.
And the Graasi knew who was at the demonstration, and when the doneah had known, who the leader would have been, maybe it's never happened.
The case of the Berlin wall might have not come.
And then, by the way, the case of the iceberg.
Because today, state agency and companies want to store so many information as they can get about us, online and online.
They want the possibility to track our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight to self-determination today.
You have to fight for this every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
And when you go home, you say your representative, just because companies and state states have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company to get the information you've stored on them.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-interest in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Trijectional shops, rapid restaurants, Brakel.
So the city plan is coming and they changed the name of South Central to make it different, and it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Siscriminate stores, rapid restaurants, Braille spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-throon and the Driveybys.
The comal is that the Drivehrum is killing more people than the Driveybys.
People in South Central Los Angeles die in unbiased diseases.
Now, obesity rate in my neighborhood, for example, is about five times higher than at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even get that.
And I wondered how you would feel, if you had no access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that have been on your neighborhood.
I've made a chance to buy the rollmill and sell as a transport.
I see dialogue centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that this has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't really feel like a lot of fun at 45-minute marriage to get a apple that's not pre-invasive.
So I planted a food pump on my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park plant.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay in."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and I came up with my group, the L.A. Green Grass, and we started to plant my food and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a professional group of reconnecting from all the social layers and all over the city, and it's completely voluntary, and all we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else was confused.
The city came to me and he was basically putting a bullet and said that I had to get rid of my garden, the head was a legal framework.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A narrative of food from a piece of food that's totally different to you?
And I thought, "Cool. Herself."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times received wind from it. Steve Lopez, and spoke about the city of Green on the city, and with a member of Green Ground, they put a petition on Change.org and with 900 signatures.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My town even called it and said they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why don't they want to do that?
L.A. has the most of the hardware in the United States in the country.
They have 67 miles in the hardware room.
These are 20 Central parks.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato sauce.
Why the devil shouldn't you find that right?
And then you get 1,000 seeds to grow up with the crop.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my boss driver's empowerment, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To build its own food, it's like to print its own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more reluctant to be part of this preconceptive reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
So, I'm a gardenwork. I'm planting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I swear, I swear lawns and park spaces.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my own time for this stuff.
You might be surprised to see what the Earth's soil can do when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunset is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
You'd be surprised by how kids are affected by this.
So, the most sophisticated act of the therapeutic and the most exciting act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you can get strawberries.
I remember this time when this mother came and her daughter, it was about 10 to 10 at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not because of the road."
I've been embarrassed when I saw people who are so close to me and hungry, and that just hurt me, and people would say, "You're not afraid you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum devil, no, I'm not afraid they're going to be cool.
And it's still on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take care of their health."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in D.C.
These are the guys who helped me to run the chair.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how they planted their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, maybe only for a moment.
Green Grounds have already planted about 20 gardens.
and we came to our instincts and got 50 people and made them all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get anything, if they're not shown, how food and bodies affect, they're going to eat blind, whatever you're doing with them.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick into this thing -- I see color kids that are just on the path that they're comfortable for, and they're not going nowhere.
And I see the gardeners as a chance to train these kids to maintain their communities to live a sustainable life.
And when we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood block in gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipscontapons and turn them into a healthy cafe.
So, you know, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-nush, because free is not sustainable.
The cometing of sustainability is that you have to stop them.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and to let them enjoy the joy, to let the pride and the honor, if you build your own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make it sexy.
I want to be the green rebels, the gangbades, the gangfly.
We have to turn the image of the ganglight.
If you're not a gisser, you're not a gang.
You're going to have a shower with a carpenter, right?
And let's just take the gun to your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me at all, when you want to sit in the paranormal chairs and get a meeting where you talk about it, some kind of stuff.
If you want to meet me, you come to your lawns, in my backyard, so we can plant some kind of stick.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford English dictionary is "nnnnyyyy Monaster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nnnnary" means "nonless politician."
And although in the 19th century, a newspaper editor was a better definition: "A Snolly Snidid, someone who is fighting in a state, independent party, program, or post office, and his success by the pure monopoly of the monopoly.
I have no idea what's done.
Something that I think is something about.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers were not just the exact word of debating the debut.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with extraordinary name called Cillelby, who had been working on parliament.
And they threw him to the Tower in London and he was brave enough, but he was brave enough to win, and finally he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so" as well as Brassutus, many people think.
Brettes are all about the English word for a bike.
But that's not true. It's coming back to a leading press of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to the United States, at the time when it's reached independence.
You're looking at the question, how to call George Washington, the state of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader a national nation?
and it's been debated in Congress for a long time.
And there were all sorts of ideas that were available.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his greatity of George Washington, and others, the freedom of the people in the United States, from Washington.
Not so much more comfortable.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it's been approved.
They were not monarchist, they wanted to vote for the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored in the conversation, because this debate was three weeks ago.
I read the days of a leader, and I was reading the same thing, and I said, "I've got the same issue."
The reason for the delay and the bored was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want to be done by Washington. They didn't want to.
King, and maybe even to give him a new message to his own.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most vulnerable title that they could take.
This title was "Permith."
President. They didn't invent the title. He was just about it, but he meant that someone was running a meeting.
This is something like the introduction of a jury.
He didn't have any size anymore than the record "throon" or "talking water."
Sometimes there were little colonial groups and government groups, but it was really unconvenuous title.
That's why the Senate refused to let him down.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up and meet foreign police.
Who's going to take him seriously when he has a stupid little title like President of America?
And then, after three weeks, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, you're not going to use the title "discovered" but they really wanted to understand that they were not agreed to be honest with the ideas of being and civilized, or in the state, where it's the state of the state, that the uns not necessarily the singular name of the state, not the person's asserting the person's asserting the person.
You can learn three interesting things.
One, and I think that's the best -- well, I can't figure out if the Senate ever has been officially called the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just celebrated the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- well, you're going to wait 223 years later.
And third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of the United States today sounds so gracefully, isn't it so gracefully, right?
It's something that has to do with more than 5,000 nuclear wasteheads that he has and the largest economy in the world and a drone drone drone and all that stuff.
History and story have given the title.
And so the Senate ended up.
You have a respectful title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the head of self-esteem, well, it was like this.
You know, how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this, like the guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, the audience lost, because nobody feels more humble when you're told, you're now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take to you, and I'll leave you with this.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but actually change the reality much more than words can ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a vaster, about 50 degrees to fight to Mr. Dealalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would just like to get my black Conclipers against a pair of brown leather and a rocket in the direction of the government-filled, I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been a long time before the war, but besides the side of Pyjama and football game, and playing with racist-state combat and interstate protesters who live with no communist communism and Afghanistan and Afghanistan and Viennhord, before I knew what to do.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm standing here, I've got a little more educated Afghans, South nations of God's G<unk>nnesty, an atheist, and a radically political artist who's lived in Afghanistan last nine years, and I've worked.
So there's a lot of great things in Afghanistan that you could do with art, but I really don't like to paint rainworms. I want to make art that makes the personality and authority and re-creating reality and even using a kind of a more sophisticated, sophisticated citizen to try to understand the world that we live.
I want to spend a day in life of jihad, the name of jihad, the jihad, the way that it's led to the communist, the way that it's called "Popopelel" and it's been used to avoid religious and political corruption.
And what else can be done to the jihad-to-the-the-the-the-the-century, as the parliament, and to a election campaign, to the slogan, "Wake me! I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to allow these maciosiosi that spend themselves as national heroes.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rearing," where you're going to be a police station on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking money and give them money to them, and the police in Kabul, and they'll hope that they'll take 100 percent of them to the police.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become the Cropique conflict.
The war and the stranger's views that came with him, have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was able to create a local Afghan arm with a paron or a two-touched, or a neonididous, a neon.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan of Kabul looks like Kipligellell from 1899 to create dialogue about the current development of developing European dictatorship in the past-war speaking of the gay man to protect the brown man and maybe even a civil.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misdirected.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of self.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
I've been saying, for 10 years, right?
I feel that now in the room, there's a very unconventional tension, because I wouldn't have to wear that dress.
Fortunately, I'm going to have some more time to change.
This is the first time someone is walking to the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness, I think.
If a few women were really pissed out when I came out, you don't need me to tell me this now, I'll read it later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm very privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
And it's not the chance of all.
These intersections are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because you're all going to let me stop me, so you don't do anything until it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this image.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to put my back oil and with my hand on this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong cals that I've been working on for two days, there's only very few ways to change our own ignorance, and our misinterention, although it's super-conventable, and it's a big impact on our lives.
Silenceless to me is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and I'm in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
Now I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but to the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy, and maybe you might ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we've only defined beauty not just as healthy and young and symmetrical, in the way that we're programmed to be biologically, but also as big, feminine and bright.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's been paid to me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this, and maybe some kind of fashion provider calls, "Haltomi, Tyra, Tyra. Sman Smel.
And first, I'm going to talk about your model. Very impressive.
But I'm sorry that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at the time of NYU has all been counted on the surface, every single one that's been executed, and that 67700s were not only white, or 27 percent.
The next question that's always asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I said, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which is completely wrong, because you're the first one."
And when they say, after they go to this amazing, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "I'm going to be my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;MM: Or the next Steven Meel.
To say, you want to be a model later, as if you're going to say, you want to win the Jackto in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of the model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can just be seen.
If there's a photographer and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo in the run," and then the leg first, and then, on the back of the arm, the back is on the side, the foot is on the side, and you just move back to the side, and you just see 300 friends back, and 300 times back to it.
It looks like this.
I hope that it's less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's happened.
And if you finish the school and you have a life cycle and you've done a few jobs, unfortunately you can't say much more, because if you want to be President of the United States, but you're going to be looking at "10167 underwear," you're going to look at weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who is the one that's going to feed all photos?"
And yes, so much of the photos are being ded, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I've done, and that was the very first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know this is going to be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
And so I just saw it just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the Shack.
My friend had to come up with me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days ago, on a cliff for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-C magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images aren't images of me.
They're constructors, and they're building structures of professionals, from Hairstylists and Toup and photographers and protylists and all their assistants and the prostitution. They're not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Do you have things for free?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-foot-touchers I can never wear, except just the things I get free are things I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and they were tracking a red light, and of course we stopped, and it just took me: "Excuse me, Mr. Words," and we could go on.
I've got this costless things to look at my appearance, and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay attention to their personality, and not paying a high price.
I live in New York and from 140 teenage boys who were stopped and shot in the last year, 85 percent black and Latinos and mostly young men.
It's only 177,000 young, male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Who am I going to stop?"
"How often am I going to stop? When I'm stopped?"
And I found myself in this talk, and I found that 53 percent of all of the 13 year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is up to 78 percent when they've become 17 percent.
The last question I've ever asked you is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting that answer: "If you have a little bit of thin hair and a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And we give back-up back to a response that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
And it's true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera I never said before, is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about what my view is every day.
And if you ever ask, "Did I be happier if I had thin legs and darker hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool flam, and they're probably the most vulnerable women on the planet.
And when I was preparing this talk, it seemed really difficult to me to move a more honest balance, because on the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come here and say, "I've got all the benefits that are being put in my own favor," and it doesn't feel very good enough to do that."
It was especially difficult to put a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the biggest users.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great to get here before I've been done, or 30 years, and my career is still unfinished, because I wouldn't say, I'm not going to be a job, or I'd have been paying my first job, or I've paid to tell you what I'm paid to do now.
And if you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our pre-cooding and failure.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exilil, "Son, man's braafi, Resignity.
But never get to something like a Gaddafafi revolution."
It's almost two years since the monropated revolution, inspired by the waves of mass-pancing and in the Tunisian revolution.
I would connect with many other neesyers, in the outside of the valley, to challenge a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyranny regime.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, Grandby-Book women and men stood in the first row, the end of the regime, held Slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
They've demonstrated an example of the courage to deal with the brutal dictator of Gaddafafis.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity, from far from the far east to the far east to the south.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead deaths, we managed to liberate our country and fight the tyranny.
Now, Gaddafi has left a big hospital, a legacy of tyranny, and the foundation for the course of corruption.
Over four decades, Gaddafafannis's regime has destroyed both infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the lyy society.
The devastation and the challenges, I proposed how many women, to rebuild the civil society of Lyybas, and we asked the creation of national and national and national jurisdance.
Near to 200 organizations, and immediately after the Gaddafis in Benghazzi, almost 300 miles in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exil, I came back to Lybas, and I started working with unique enthusiasm, and I started to organize workshops, human development and leadership.
And with a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform, a movement of women, leaders, leaders of different forms of life, their goal, is to be engaged in the sociological empowerment of women and to embrace the right as a rights of democracy and democracy.
And I met a very difficult environment, which was always very difficult to meet, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by selfish politics and dominance.
I was campaigning a democratic platform for peacebuilder, to reach a legal law, a law that would give every citizen, no matter what context, and to vote, and to put on a political negotiation between a male and female and two-dimensional, and to put a straight-down bill.
At the end, we've been taken away and successful.
Women won 1755 percent of the nation's national elections since 52 years.
But long, but the euphemial of the elections and the whole revolution, because every day we started to get the new news from violence.
And we were announcing a morning to the lead of ancient mosques and Sufi leaders.
In another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to the message.
And then, in another morning, the suicide bombers were prosecuted by the army.
And so, every day, we're at the tyranny of the Treanasas and their ongoing, the human prisoner's rights, and their contempt of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized, and distant from the ideals and principles, dignity, social justice, and they were beginning to follow it.
Intent, rejection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our discourse and the elections.
I'm actually here today to say that we've made the wrong choices as a nation, the wrong choices.
We've put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or safety in Lybia.
Did the hardest and the shift between female and male candidates and nationalism have?
No, she doesn't.
What is it?
Why is our society going to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics and the dominance and both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only one who missed, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade, and the accident.
Our society needs a national dialogue and dialogue process as it needed to increase the elections that have only increased the polarization and perpetrators.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female as the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of anger and demand a day of the revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the gade.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't just lead the results, but also to say, Gicename instead of working, instead of lacking a competition.
These are the ideals that need a war to be fought in love with peace.
Because peace has an alchemie and in this alchemie, it's about the seduction of feminine and masks.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do that in an existential situation before we do it as a sociology.
After a stop from the Koran's "Salam" -- "the God's word of the Good God, slush."
The word "raveem" is, again, the whole well-knownly known in the latehamian traditions, the same Arabic root as the word "lrawn" and symbolically the female feminine, the whole human being, the male and the female's female.
And just like the mother, the patient, grows in his embryo, completely so it's so much the underlying of compassion.
And so we were told to us, "My Gadeah, all things are coming."
And so we told us, "My Gadeame has already been my way to my TEDx."
And let's all be allowed to be the gissade of the gum.
Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In the school, we started the history of Kiml-Ilung, but we didn't really learn much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea to change all of this change.
At seven years old, I saw a public transport, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had never had to suffer from myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter, from my sister's sister's sister's sister.
And it said, "If you were here, our five family members are not going to be in the world, because we've never eaten anything for two weeks.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about people in my country for the first time.
And I went through the trainway and saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A black woman was on the ground, and a broken child in her arm was just blind in her mother's face.
But nobody helped them because all of them were busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'90s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans liked the victims, and many more people survived, because they ate grass, beetles and celelel.
and the flooding are increasingly likely to keep me out at night, except the lights of China on the other side of the pyramid that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amp, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very profound and allow Northstoreans to escape.
Many die.
I saw bodies moving into the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the devastating years of famine to the relatives of China.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I'd never thought it would take 14 years to work again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as a Northstore refugee. But soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but also North Korean refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
And one day, my biggest nightmare dream was true when I was caught by the Chinese police department and was thrown into the police department.
Somebody was accused of being Northstore, so they tested my Chinese and gave me countless questions.
I had this fear, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything unnatural seems, I could be locked up and hidden.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
And after they finished the interview, a official said to the other one, "That was a wrong thing.
She's not Northstore.
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
and some North Koreans are taking into China's foreign messages, asylyl, but they're being caught by the Chinese police.
These girls had great luck.
Although they're caught, they finally ended up by tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China, and they're already released to North Korea, where they're tortured, or they're being locked up in public.
Although I was lucky at my heart, there are many other Northstoreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle to survive.
and after she's learned a new language and work, her world can be put into the head in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was going to leave South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I also realized that the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of it, we're very close to each other, because of 67 years,
I went through a identity crisis.
Am I a South or Northstore?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean lives didn't even fall easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording.
Just as I was being more aggressive about my new life, I got an shocking call.
The North Korean authorities started to send the money I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family forced to participate in a remote place.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to go back to an incredible route to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and made me go back to the northwest border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, more than 2,000 miles across China, and then South Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we've been caught almost a few times.
Once one time, when the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the point of all of the time and started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were being arrested.
When the Chinese official gave me my family, I decided to stand up and told him that she was a child, and I was a leader.
He looked at me, and luckily he believed in me.
We managed to get it to the cigotic border, but I had to almost get all my money to get the borderline of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was imprisoned, because of illegal border.
After I paid money and a bribe, my family was released in a month, but just to get back to my family, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest routes of my life.
I had done everything to avoid my family's freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went and I went across the intergressional Union and the police department, and I tried to free my family, but I had no money to pay money to the cash or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised by being a stranger.
In broken English and I explained to a dictionary without being able to go to a bank engine and pay the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I was delighted by him from all my heart and I said, "Why help me help you?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to help the Northern Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous people who have ever described to me, a new hope that needs to have the North Koreans, and he showed me the friend of strangers and support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
And finally, after our long journey, my family and I've come together in southern Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
and most North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they come into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us to engage in education, to learn English, to learn the work of education and to many more.
We can also be able to change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because a lot of us still remain in contact with families, and we're going to send them information and money that helps to change North from inside.
I had so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, I want to be able to prevent the hope of Northern Ireland, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see a lot more successful North Koreans all over the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just got a request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi 22, and very good sight.
He can't speak, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide it, and he's not allowed to put it in.
It's not too stupid. He doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, his thinking is not even about words that I remember, he reminds me of a thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be.
Samuel is 16 years old. He's very good.
It's got absolutely unknoodable memory.
but it also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he's stolen my chocolate fridge, but he remembers the publication of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the first result of the tea club on my arm and Lady's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they often have been understood and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul was that although it was the case, although it was not normally popular, it only meant that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with the term "compassionism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that's influenced by social communication, learning and physical abilities.
It's actually a different aspect of each individual, so it's Remii as far as Sam.
And the world is going to recognize every 20 minutes in a new person's autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm living with autism, but I can't remember myself without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He's a lot of fun.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and he didn't really seem to be very interested in me.
Remi lived in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a row, put the washing machine and eating everything underneath him.
And as he was older, he was completely different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the shaman and the never end of hyperactivity, something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had ever heard.
Except extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these things I wouldn't want to compete against normality.
Normalality is looking at the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody of us has a gift, and all of us, in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of survivors.
The chance for scale, progress and change dies in the moment we try to be something different.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Doc Edockon has filled us with awe and curiosity with this photo on a project of a apple and a massility period of only one and a half a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the Femto-Rouse photography, a new engineering technology that's so fast that it can create slow-time images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look at the outside of our view, or see in a <unk>-ray image in our bodies, and actually ask what we do with the camera.
Now, if I take a laserck and I take it in a billionth-by-half-by-half-by-half-by-by-one-one-one-second, I'm creating a package of photons that hardly a millimeter, and this photonsuit, this project, will move faster, speed, and speed, and -- and as I said, a million times a second.
So, if you take this project, this photonsuit, and you take it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's the way light looks like in slow motion?
So, this whole event --
So, you think, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotatch -- so long as long as we need to get back to this route -- but I'm going to try to get this video to the factor 10 billion to see the light in the movement.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photonsuit, starts to move through and eventually break into the inside.
A part of the light is moving out to the table, and you see that spread from the waves.
Many of the photons are ultimately reaching the tail of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in there that's moving around in the bottle.
And meanwhile, the waves are coming up on the table, and because of the reflection of the reflective patterns that are focused on the end of the bottle after some images.
Now, if you take a common project and take it back and take the same route back and down the video to the factor 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, a week? No, one year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a still life photographer?
You can see again, as these waves go on the table, the Tomber and the wall in the background.
It's like having a stone in a pond.
And it seemed like I was painting the nature of a photo, at one time, a Femto-to-Rouse image, but of course, our eye looks a collection.
But if you look at these Tomats, you'll see that when the light blows the Tom's lights, that's still not dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomder is on and the light goes around and it's coming back to a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto-Mouse is built in your Camerahyy, it might be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if an fruit is closed without touching it.
So how did my team built this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a short-term length of air, you have very little light, but we have a billion times faster than your shortest expansion, so you get pretty much light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this project, this photonsuit, and I'm going to draw a million times, and again, with very clever synchronic, and combine this gigabytes of data, we're actually doing it to make these militto-s video that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superheroes, can see corners?
The idea is that we're going to turn something into the door.
It's going to be cut into the space, and it's going to be reflected back into the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could exploit this more nuanced, more of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left, you see our Femto-Mamera.
Behind the wall is hidden, and we're going to take the light off the door.
And after our paper was published in theNature Communications, it was made out of Nature.com, and they created these animation.
We're going to take this light project and we're going to put it into this wall, and we're going to put these photons, and these photons are all over and all of the photons are being trapped in the way, and some of the photons will be trapped in our hidden soup, and then the door will reflect a little bit of light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the surface.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our FemtoM camera has some unique abilities.
It's got a very good time-to-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-moment world.
And of course, by the way, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is to escape.
And by turning a laser, we can take a little bit of a stick-up image, like the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light circuit, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We've got a little bit to do, before we can do this in the lab, we can build cars that avoid collisions, and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous deaths, by looking at light, and we can build the window, or we can build the end of the window, or we can see the end of the body deep, and the sand, and the sand in the middle of the box.
But because of the eagle and tissue, that's very challenging, and that's why this is really a roll-up call for scientists, now, to think about Femtoto-Mill photography, because a new imaging process can actually solve the next generation of medical imaging.
So, like a Docptton, even a scientist, is a science has become a art of the ultra-second photography, and I realized that all of these billions of data that we're using every single time, we can also create a new form of a computer, a memory, and we can only take a sequence of the memory, and we can see that we can see that we can see that of the memory and the memory.
But it's also something funny about this.
And when you look at the waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost flying in light, in some strange effects, and Einstein would like to see this picture.
The order, in the history of the world, in the process, is going to appear in the camera, in the process, by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So don't it matter whether to be able to look around photography or to really push a new representation of imagination to medicine or new roles, since we've been able to open up all of our ideas and hope that the co-in-in-in-in-in-in-visrative research, and the research community, we should stop us from the data, to the question.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many wisdom promises are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and to do things like toys, shramps and circles.
The projects came from my questions, how much renting my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories from the buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for resurrected homes so that our communities and our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is chilling by the huge eternies that have been with hundreds of years of loved, drunk and trauma, and trauma, I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the land's names in America.
I'm walking near this house and thinking about how I could get it, and I thought about something that has changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me, and her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it brought me clarity to the things that I've been interested in in in in now in life.
But it's hard to keep that view of time every day.
It's easy to lose your lives and forget what's really important.
And with the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the house into a huge blackboard and I wrote a bridge between the gaps, "I want to die, I want everybody to come back, and take a piece of chalk, thinking about his life and share his hopes in this public.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day was completely filled with the wall, and they grew.
I want to share some sentences with you, which was written by the people in the wall.
I'd like to die, I want to be suited by piracy."
I'd like to die, I want to be close to the International Talk.
"I want to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
I'd like to die, I want to plant a tree."
I want to die, I want to live "weed."
"I'd let her die again." I'd like to keep them in my arms."
"I'd let you die, I want to be a guy's art tower."
"I want to die, I want to be my own self."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine, and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and making a new and unfolding way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and remembering what's most important, while we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I've given hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction box, and now in countries like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Spain and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices and share more with others.
So the two of the most valuable things we have, is time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, to look at things that are really close to the right and to think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often neglected by talking about death, or just thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation is one of the things that most of us are strengthaging.
The idea of death is to really illustrate the life.
And our common spaces are the best important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities, to share our hopes, to share our fears and stories, to help people around us, to help us live better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in this, I'm involved with an effective problem for anyone who's involved in being more seductive mathematics, that we're a business leader.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain what I do today.
And dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're thrilled by looking at the audition of the feathers and the feathers, as you'll see.
So the ballett are an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and possibly a basic eternation that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy these extraordinary ability, and that's what it does in my blogging, Janel Abart, who was on his time, was a balletomy.
Over the years, you've done a lot of advances in treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people living on this disease, and they have to deal with the unomquency symptom, like weakness, death, scarility, and others living that disease, so we need objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We have to measure the progress objective objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there's cure, if we have a objective measure that question.
Now, trouble is that there's no cognitive activity in Parkinson's and other movements, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing that you can do is that this 20th-century test is the neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies, never done it.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a pre-cussing tour to the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't have to be a expensive hospital.
It's actually 300 percent, by the way, to explore in the neurologic unit.
And so I want to propose to you, in an unconventional way, where we're trying to achieve this, because we're all, in some sense, virtual, like my name of Janel Abart.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal cliff.
That's what happens in the normal state when someone's voice sounds, we can look at the common ballier dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs, if we could put the sounds, and we all have the genes for that. Fox C.C.
And as ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to get to read it.
And by the way, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal cliff, and so the limbs are also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom, you can see an example of irregular vocalization.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Silence, weakness, cphemity.
The language is even more and more blind and so on, and that's an example of the way.
And this implications of the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and the anticide analysis, combined with new machine-machine learning, which is now advanced, so we can now figure out where someone is in a vubon between the disease and the brain, just by the sounds.
How do we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not both non-invasive. The test is the neurologists.
That's not too little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build a new clinics for this.
And both of them are exactly right. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very quick, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
So this amazing goals can be done now.
We can reduce logistic difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine interfaces in the hospital.
We can get objective data from overcoming observation.
We can do cheap mass-payed intervention for clinical trials, and we can take the first time to the whole population.
We now have the possibility to look for biomarkes to the disease before it's too late.
Now, we're going to start to take the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's disease-based.
We want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have high-speed components for the goals that are available.
We have a call-babite that's available to three-quarters of people on this planet.
Everyone, with Parkinson's disease, can be using cheaply, to leave a few cents, and I'll admit, with joy, we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of it, let's take 10,000 people, you can say, who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to be cured during the call, whether this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease, right?
Some of them may not be able to finish it.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting, and these conditions matter, because we're in order to put this into order to identify what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, their 86 percent accuracy is on the time?
It's much better.
My students, Thisisis -- I have to put it on it because he's done such amazing work -- has shown that it's also working on the network of network, which allows this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
This is what I call improvement.
That means that people can call the phone and send the test to the phone, and people could call the Parkinson's disease, send their voice to the fact that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Jake, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You can see the cows behind my father and behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the south, in a small way, and that means that wildlife are able to leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning and found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buug.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believes that we came together with our animals and the Farid Rainforest, so our animals are so much.
I learned to hate lions as a child.
Our warrior Morans, they protect our tribe and our ancestors. They're also given to this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's just as few lions in Nairobi.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for the cows and nine years, and so I was on my father.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but to help the lion help the cows see better.
But I didn't get up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to get a bird.
I wanted the lion to think I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You get to see the bird and go back to the next time, and you come back and they say, the thing doesn't really move, it's still here.
And they take the position and kill our livestock.
And one night, I stopped the St. I went over with a torch to the hand around him, and this time the lions didn't catch it.
And lions fear light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
I worked in my room as a little boy all day, and I once took the new radio of my mother, and the day she took me almost, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a motor drive, and I put it out of a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn right or left, it's blinking.
And I got a switch to switch and turn the lights off.
This is a little bit of a broken bag lamp.
And then I built all of this together.
The solar column is releasing the battery, which provides electricity to the server. I call it a transformer.
And the driver's right?
You can see that the halches are outside, because of where the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are flashing and the lions believe I'm going to the edge, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our home, and since then, we have no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped from that.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yeah."
I put the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good at their own.
Now, my idea is now used in Kenya, including other predators like hygiene or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from sea farms.
My invention took me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved, and it helps by fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in the world where there's no one, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
I just took a year from the savanna, who was eating my father's planes and said, "Eother I'm going to sit in one of them."
And here I am.
I had to make a plane change for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and a pilot, that's my big dream.
I used to be a little while. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can relate to the side of the lions, without the arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, "I thank you very much.
You don't even know how exciting it is to hear a story like you're listening.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next part of the list?
So my next invention, now, I work on an electric fence. An electrodeolic?
Yes, I know that electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've just tried it before, right -- Yeah, I tried it, but I've tried to get back, because I got a stroke.
So it's very hard. Richard Turer, you're kind of special.
We're going to invite you to move to your house, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you my 15 favorite experiences, and not one of them.
There was no kind of masterpiece, no style, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even to be considered the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot from random tourists.
My story starts as I was at a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture, where I gave my daughter on my first birthday, and we were on the corner of 57 and 5th.
So just a year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see what's going on here ...
And when the third birthday came to my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why do you want Sabina to New York and do a father's son's first-granddad to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal object, when you get a complete stranger, you know, your camera is going to be enough.
Nobody ever said no, and the lucky one is never even with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a shot moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to keep time in October, and to change time and how we are coming year after year, not just physically, but in all, to reflect.
Although we're always doing the same picture, our perspective is changing as they reach more time, and as they reach more and more new corridors, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything they do, and how they see it.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect every year.
So recently, as we go out of our travel, we went for a walk, and suddenly they're all over, and they're on a red bar on a deer like they'd learned as a little child, in the previous day.
And she told me about her feelings she had as a five-year-old about this particular thing.
She said she was reminded of her heart of her chest when she saw the store at the first time nine years ago.
And now she looks at her in New York to high school schools, because she's really interested in college in New York.
And I realized that it was clear. The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious way of memory.
I don't know what it looks like, but besides these 15 pictures, I'm hardly very much of a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does this image.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image and not ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
BLEU = 23.94, 55.3/31.6/19.4/12.1 (BP=0.945, ration=0.946)
