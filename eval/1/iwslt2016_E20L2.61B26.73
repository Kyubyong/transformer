When I was 11 years old, I was woken from the sounds of the ringing moments one morning.
My father listened to his little radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was rather unusual at the time, because he was most likely to depress the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but obviously my father made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban were taking the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were prohibiting girls to go to school.
And so for five years I was discharged as a boy and I was with my older sister who was no longer allowed to go alone to a secret school.
That's the only way we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different path so nobody could guess where we were going.
We were sitting in a shopping bag for our books to look like we were just going to buy.
We were doing this in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was comfortable, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives, teachers, students and our parents.
After all, the class had to suddenly drop out for a week because the Taliban had swallowed the weight.
We'd never really know how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school anyway.
I was lucky enough to grow up in a family in education as important and daughters were valued.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
One of the outsiders from a remote province of Afghanistan. He insisted to send my daughter -- my mother -- to school and was distracted by his father.
My mother was educated, but she became a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- and here, was the first person in his family who ever received a school education.
For him, it was always clear that his children would be educated, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
and he saw it as a much larger risk of not sending his kids to school.
I remember that in the years I was sometimes so frustrated by the Taliban, we were so frustrated by our lives, by the constant fear and the perspective of immatability.
I was so good to give up, but my father would say, "Tdaughter, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing you're going to always be doing is stay, what's inside of it. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So, you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that had been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have higher degree than the Sek-Dar School, and if my family hadn't been used so hard for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I stand here today, as a proud ex-varter of the Middlebury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he proved to send his daughters to school, one of the first was congratulating me.
He doesn't just leave me with my graduate degree, but also for the first woman I was, and I'm driving him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have great dreams, but my family has even greater dreams for me.
That's why I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a world campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start building SOLA, the first and possibly the only board service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school school girls are still risky.
It's so wonderful to see how the students of my school, with great ambition, want to take their chances of opportunity.
And seeing their parents and fathers stand for them, and like my parents at the time, despite all odds, including all the time.
As Ahmed Ahmed. It's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is one of my students' father.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA into her village, and they're killed by a bomb on the side of the road by a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang and a voice would ring to him if he sent his daughter to school, they would try again.
And he said, "Take me now, if you want, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your old-talking and over-exfived ideas."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often prevented in the West: behind most of us who succeed, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and is aware that their success is also successable.
Now, that's not to say that our mothers don't play an important role in our success.
They're often the ones that are common to realize and predict a lot of promise of their daughters' future, but in a society like Afghanistan, men are absolutely uncapable.
The Taliban only went only a few hundred girls to school, because it was illegal.
Today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls push the school bank.
Afghanistan appears like America, that's the way.
Americans recognize how unsure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the length and changes with the citizens' markets.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them to encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan, for me, is a country of hope and the unchanging possibility, and remember the girl coming every day, the SOLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as I'm living -- my life was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not -- -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to projects with engineering collaborators with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO project, and I failed to do every single project we put on my legs.
I was desperate.
I mean, 21 years ago, thought that we're good at Italy, and we're doing good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we used to do.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book I did, called "Ripples to the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of Italy to the Sambias, how to raise food.
We came to the local Italian seed in South Africa, to this silent valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We taught the local local adult crop of Italian tomato and Zuchini and ...
Of course, the local authorities were absolutely not interested in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came to work.
And we were astounded that there was no agricultural crops in that fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here!"
Voice 2: Yet in time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had these ferry tomatoes. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the queens, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato tires and red were turned down overnight, about 200 plumperers came out of the river and everything.
We said to the Sambult queens, "Oh my God, the royal!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were so great at the gruty in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the Americans did, what the French did, and after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud to be a story on our project in Zambia.
We were feeding the uteress at least.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we've made of our African people.
They should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, who is a joint economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given Seberers' African continent 1.5 trillion Euros over the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what that money did.
Just read your book.
Consider one African African woman, what we did.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we patron them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words come from the Latin root to the pater, which means home.
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisination: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bwana, head, boss.
I became more pissed up when I read the book "Syall Beautiful" by the way. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, they'll leave you alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, set a pole on the floor, and asked him, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocololonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just react to people, and I created a system called the U.S. which never is initiated, never gets motivated, but you become the service of local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you sit down with the local people.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in Kneipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We want to close your friend's work and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody an idea.
If that person doesn't like it, what do you do?
The passion for your growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in human history.
We're helping them find knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
Now, the person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one trap: Why not join in a community and say, what are they supposed to do, why don't we hear them? Not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Never would entrepreneurs have participate, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what choices they see.
Let's have a light-in-brain.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working on one thing to do that, and that's what we're doing, we've got to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the residential physician of the company, the hospital of the business room you're sitting in your house, your kitchen table, and the cafe, helps you find the resources, your passion, in a way, to transform the life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was a doctor who was now trying to escape the disengrous insanating, where we tell others what to do.
And so I walked through the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, my first clients, and I helped him. He was a fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then after, the fishermen came along and said, "You helped the maoro. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers, and I worked together, and I couldn't sell them to a factory in Albany for 60 cents <unk>Kilo, but to Japan for sushi for 15 dollars sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them? Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very, very hard.
I'm holding their mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- So the government says, "Let's do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the founding world.
There's a new generation of companies that go to loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best CEO of history, died at 96 years ago.
Peter was a philosophy professor before talking to companies, and Peter Spiel put it in, and he said, "Design is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So programming is the death of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, not knowing what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get you to one.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to be missing.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What the best thing you've ever applaud today?
"Some, passionate people. You applaud that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- misguided fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The free-style world of preservation is unsustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, create, transport them, and share them with them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
Government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to talk about the future of the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and speculate what would happen in the city of New York 100 years ago, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows on this rate, they needed six million horses to get people to be taken, and it was impossible to get the scratch of six million horses.
Because they were already lying under the crap.
In fact, 1860s, they see the dirty technology that sucks the lives of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little small factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing you need to do is not get a conversation deal.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
and then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of us have to do three things: to sell the product must be grand, the market market market has to be grand, and the financial sector needs to be huge.
What do you think?
We never met a single person who can make something, and then sell and take care of money.
That's not true of those things.
This person was never born.
We did research and looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been mean to be common in the world, except one person, was founded by one person.
We teach 16 year-old women in Northland entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them to give the first two pages of Richard Bransons Imaging, and the task of 16 year-old children is to help them bring in the first two sides of Richard Bransons Imscreen, how often he uses the word "ich" and how often the word "we" is.
Never "<unk>ich" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where a group of developers have a small background in cafes and Bars, and their dedicated buddy who will do what someone in this gentleman speaks about this epociation is somebody who's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do it." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have collections of volunteers who support corporate advocacy in helping them find the resources and people, and we have found that the wonders of local intelligence can transform the culture and the economy of that community can only capture the passion, the energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should be to be Alice in the miracles country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a faculty for communication -- to draw educational lessons into communication.
I was scared.
I mean, really afraid of those students with their large brains and their large books and their large ones, I'm not trusting words.
But when the conversation evolved, it was as Alice, as she walked down to the guel to the guest waspant, and a door was watching a whole new world.
I felt the same way when I was talking to the students, and I was amazed at the idea that they had, and I wanted others to discover this miracle country.
I think that to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need to really have great communications with our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the biggest problems we face, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know anything about it and don't understand it, then it's not going to go. I think that in our responsibility, as a non-scientist, is to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, let's face up.
I want to show you a few ways of doing it, how you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to is, and what?
Let's tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that their grazing is studying their grazing, but it also tells us that their grazing, your handling structure, is examining your bones, because it's important to understand and treat osteoposis.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to get pronounced.
Now, the subject is an obstacle to your mind.
I'm sure you could, surely, use your "happy time and time," but why don't you just say "space and time," which is far more understandable for us?
to make your mind understandable is not the same as pushing down your level.
As Einstein said earlier, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without having to deal with any compromise.
So a few things about this. An example of examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can get us to your ass.
And if you present your work, let's get the positions away.
Have you ever wondered why it's called the point?
What happens when someone else? Another one is taken to it, and with those dots, their first points, your audience.
Now, a slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the talk-mits-the-mits-masting part of the brain, and that's how we're being challenged very quickly.
This is the example of Genevieve Brown, which is much more effective. It shows that the specific structure of the feathers so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick is here to use an individual, easy-readed sentence where the audience, once it loses the thread, treat images and graphs that also address our other senses, and thereby create a deeper understanding of what it means.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open those doors and see the wonderland, science and technology.
because the engineers I've taught have taught me how to put the "Nerd" in me, I want to sum it all up with an equation.
Look at your science shows and your arguments, they divide through the relevance, so the audience says what's important, and multiply the whole thing you have for your incredible work, and that comes with incredible interactions that are unimaginable with new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was really comfortable with it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a drug with a cell phone. You can shoot a crime in Syria.
You can tweet a phone, launch a message in Egypt,
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, upload it to the sound cloud and get famous.
All of that is possible with a cell phone.
I'm year-old in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this town.
You can see there how hundreds of thousands of people were going to the road for change, showing the change.
We are in the fall of 1989, and imagine that all of these people who were coming in and asking change, had a cell phone in their bag.
Who in the room has a cell phone on it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up.
Keep it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot of them. Almost everyone today has a cell phone.
But today, my talk about me and my cell phone today, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
That's 35.30 lines full of information.
Miant data.
And why are these things there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission has set up a policy line.
The policy line is called the Department of Honurance Act.
The rule that says that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service service service in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who is sending an email?
Who is going to send a text message to whom?
And when you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And all over Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want this farm shelter.
We want to be self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet service to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people were streaming down on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Freever instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be at the start of the clock 2.0.
The Stasi was the head of oreolorei in Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered, does that really work?
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my phone, I use my phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Deutsche Tele-D, who was the biggest telephone company in Germany then, and I asked them, I asked them, we'd send all the information that you've saved of me.
And I asked her once, and she said, "I didn't get a right answer again. Just a light blue tree.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's transcripts it.
So I decided to take a court course against it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said, no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I borrow the ban on which they were asking me to send all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court court determined that the introduction of the E.U.E. issued a law enforcement response.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And then on the CD was this.
35830 lines of information.
At first, I saw it and said to me, well, it's a huge file. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make it published.
Because I want to show people what the supply of state protective is.
So with time and open data town, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, and you can zoom in and down and down.
You can track every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt to the train to Colen, and how many calls I'm making.
All of that is possible with this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like this, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then some friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you, and we have this huge network of communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who's the leader of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who is talking to who you are talking to who you are sending an email, all of that is possible to access the information.
And that information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we would imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, had cell phones in their bag.
And the Stasi would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the stamps knew who the leader was, that would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And then, not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, the state agency and companies want to store so many information about how they can get about us, online and online.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all up long.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, tell your MPs, just because companies and government countries have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to struggle for your own self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiritual office stores, rapid restaurants, bricks.
So the city planner joins up and they decided to change the name of South Central, so that it's for something else, they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that were changing something that's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Close shell stores, rapid restaurants, bricks.
Just like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert city of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivethrus and the Drivebys.
The comic thing is that the Drivethrus kills more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles for the curable conditions.
For example, obesity in my neighborhood is higher than five times, in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really understand that anymore.
And I was wondering how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, if you go out of the house, see the negative effects that are the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I made the wheelchairs buy and sell as a truck truck.
I see dialogue centers running up like Starbucks.
And I realized that must stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
I didn't really feel like a pair of up to about 45 minutes of a year-old, to get an apple that's not mediated with pesticides.
So I planted a food fire in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park park park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it there."
And I decided to keep it there.
So I would come and my group, the L.A. Green Gracle, and we would, together, and we started planting my food sofa and fruit trees, and so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of pre-mediated group, put in the blood of all the social layers and from all the city, and it's all voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then somebody else complained.
The city came to me, and he basically gave me a resolution, and said, "I've got to remove my backyard, the supply was becoming a riot of a rule.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
A fine set of prescriptions for growing food from one place of land that you don't care about?
And I thought, "Cool. Take it with it."
Because this time, it wouldn't happen.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city board, and I had a member of Green, and they submitted a petition to Change.org, and with 900 Signatures, we succeeded.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My city council even called and said, "Well, they're supporting it and love what we're doing."
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest hardware store in the United States.
They have 67 miles of hardware at the bride.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell shouldn't you find that well?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables from 75 dollars.
It's my name of mine, I tell people to grow their own food.
to grow its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I feel that I'm part of this preconceptive reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
I'm a graffiti. I'm going to collect my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who drains the walls, I sweel my lawns and air plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my actions for this cloth.
You'd be surprised what the ground world can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my backyard become an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the ground.
I'd wonder how children are affected by this.
Such as garden is the most therapeutic and the most audacious act that you can possibly do, especially in the middle of the city.
You get strawberries.
I remember that time, when that mother and her daughter came in, it was about 10 o'clock in the night, they were in my backyard, and I came out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not for the cause of the road."
I used to feel annoyed when I saw people as close to me and being hungry, and that only made me feel empowered to do that. People told me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum Devil, no, I'm not afraid of the fact that they're stealing it.
And that's what it's about in the street.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take care of your health."
Another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in Downtown.A.
These are the guys who helped me out to cash the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted them with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was just for a moment.
Green Grains have planted about 20 gardens.
And we got about 50 people and we got there, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
If they don't get any of that, if they're not shown, how the minds and bodies affect, they eat blind, whatever you're going to document them.
I see young people who are trying to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids that are just on the path that they're anticipated for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
The gardener I see as an opportunity to train these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make George Washington Carver the next one.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to.
So that's one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole residential block of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscont container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking free-emaning, because free is not sustainable.
The comedy about sustainability is you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and having them enjoy the joy of being the pride and the honor of getting them when you build your own food, and when you open farmers' markets.
So, what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to make sure that we will become all ecological rebels, gangsters, gangsta gardeners.
We have to turn the picture of skis around.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang catch.
You know, how do you have to draw a carpenter, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up in a game-to-shelf chairs and want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some clothes.
If you want to meet me, come with your shovels, in my backyard, so that we could plant some pshards.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nyollygaster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nonygoster" means "a-free political."
Although in the 19th century, a new publisher took a better definition: "A Snollygaster is someone who sits at a national officer, independent of party or program or broadcasting, and successfully achieve its success by the pure power of the monumental statistical consequences."
I have no idea what the other way to do.
I think I'll talk about it.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for example, according to the U.K. parliament, newspapers were not able to ban the exact word of debugging.
And that was actually going back to the gut of a man with an extraordinary name called Brass Crosby, who had moved to parliamentaries.
And they threw him in the Tower of London, and they loaded him, but he was brave enough, he was courageous enough to go to the head, and eventually he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for "so believe in the number of Brass."
Brussels on the word "middle for the third-chull."
But that's not true. It's going back to a secret agent of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to America, at the time when she just accomplished independence.
And you've been wondering what to call George Washington, the head of state,
You didn't know.
What is the leader of an Iranian nation?
and then there's been an awful lot of debate going on in Congress.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions to do this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the governor Washington, and others, his high-rurity George Washington, and again, the freedom of the people of the United States of America, Washington.
Not so comfortable.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was approved.
They were not monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored in a little bit because this debate had been three weeks.
I read the journal of a Senate that always writes, "Take the same topic."
The reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House was against the Senate.
The Kansas House's representative didn't want Washington to be a good job. They didn't want to.
The king would call it, and maybe it could be on ideas for his succession.
and to give him the most elusive, most driest title they could think of.
This title was "distist."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before, but only he meant that somebody was running a meeting.
It's something like the precautionary of a jury.
He had no longer the size of the record "discovery" or "discovery."
Sometimes there were President's little mass-payers and government groups, but it was really unmanned title.
And that's why the Senate refused for him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to sign the agreement and meet foreign bankers.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, you're not going to use the name "diction" in front of your head, but they absolutely wanted to make sense that they were not meant to be consent of the opinions of purpose and civil society, whether it's in the tresium, that the state of the state is not irrevible, not compelled to the president -- and that the president of the other nation's relationship with the other.
You can learn three interesting things from that.
One is -- and I think it's best -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate ever had its name in a formalized name.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just called the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that when a government says that something is temporary -- -- wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is that the most important point is, is that the title of the United States of America today is no longer so humorous, isn't it?
That's related to something more than 5,000 nuclear swamps that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
The real story has given the title of the size.
And that's how the Senate ended up winning.
You've got a respectable title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the existence of self-interest, well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations a president has?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, and the Kansas House's chief hospital lost, because nobody feels humbly when they're told you're now the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually changing the reality much more, more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I went to a truck with about 50 rebellion to the Cralalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would sit on my black Conconcessical gloves against a pair of brown leatherymles and I would roll a rocket towards the government regime I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
From the time before I'd been a war, besides the Pyjama party and football game at Samsens and Rider fought with racist South states and interfere organizations who lived in the communism and Afghanistan, and they've lived forwards and Concording the real things before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of the self.
And so I'm standing here, I think, a more educated Afghans, South nations program by God Gnades, an atheist, and a radical political artist who has been living in Afghanistan for the past nine years.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan to do about art, but I personally don't like painting rainbows. I want to make art mixed up and asking authority and informing reality and using a kind of imaginative human scientist to try and figure out the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- west who is governing its jihad against communist like "Vopop Starck" and using armed religious fear-taking corruption to enrich itself.
And what else can jihad's finalist do, as for the parliament, and for a choice campaign, with the slogan, "Please choose me! I do jihad, and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to help the pfiosi to pay attention to the national heroes.
I want to leave the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rurning" where you're a cop, an wrong control site on the streets of Kabul and the cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, provide money and giving them on behalf of the police in the Norths of Kabul, hoping that they would take the 100 of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the traditional conflict.
The war and the strange views that came along with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashionation for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was creating a wetlands with a protective plant or several interdals in a fashion-specific, open-scale art.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan in Kabul looks like Kipling Appell from 1899 to create a dialogue about the current development organizations of its origins in the past colonial rhetoric about "The Gist of the White Man" to protect the brown man from themselves and maybe even a little bit of civilized civilization.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of self is what it demands.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I've been working as a model for a while.
It's been said 10 years ago.
I felt like I was building in this room now a kind of unobakable tension, because I shouldn't wear this dress.
Thank goodness, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is raising somebody on the TED stage, so you can appreciate being happy to see that.
If there were some women who were really shooking up when I came out, you don't need to tell me that later on, I'll read you back to Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged because I can change what you think of in a very short 10-second light sequence of me.
And that's not the chance of everybody.
These tracks are very uncomfortable, it's good I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater above my head, because you're all going to wake me up, so no, as long as he's above my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
Now, image is powerful, but image is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to throw my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And beyond surgery or false balets, I began to devote myself two days ago to work, there are very few ways to change our utterness, and our utteration is -- although it's not super-simport, it's a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearful is to be honest with me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I stand on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call that an sexy girl.
So I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but nothing means anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important heritage, and you might wonder what that legacy is.
Now, in the past few centuries, we have no reason for beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, in which admiration is programmed to be biologically but as large, oppressive, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's been served for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionist letters come out, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smane. Liu."
And first of all, I describe your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has counted all the modules on the runway, each single person that's been submitted, and that 677 species were not only six or four percent white.
The next question that's always asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can be anything.
You can be President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-in-gystone monitor, which is completely misgurous, because you're the first one."
If they say, after this great trade, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Am I going to be my boss?"
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head of American birdhood or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like saying you want to win the Jackor in the numericle.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of a genetically constructed model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgeons, it can only escape now.
If there's a photographer and the light there is just like a nice radiation tank, and the client says, "Cameron, we want to run a picture," now, the leg is going to go first, long, long, long, this arm goes back, on the back of that arm, is on the side, on the side, around the side, and you just move forward, and you see, you see, your friends, 400, 400, 400, 400,
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less odd than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and have made a life cycle and a few jobs, you can't tell much more, and when you say you want to be president of the United States, but in the course of your life, "Tre like a 10-year-S- underwater gesture," you'll be considered weird.
The next question that's been asked to me is, "Who are you going to collect all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are retarded, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and this was the first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my period back then.
I know this is going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
This is just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the launch.
My friend had to come and join me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a launch for French birdry.
This is me with the football team and in V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
They're construction, and they're a group of professionals, by Hairstylists and make-up artists and photographers and Stylists and all of their assistants and the repropination. They're building it. It's not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You're doing things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot-cuffed gloves I can never wear except for a second, but the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a shop and I lost my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
As a teenager, I drove with my friend, a horrible driver, and she passed over a red light light light light, and of course it took a call: "Excuse me, Mr. Winner," and we could go on to that.
I got these useless things about my appearance, not because of my personality, and there are people who pay a lot of their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 140 teenagers who have been stopped last year, and they were 45 percent black and Latinos, and young men,
In New York, only 177,000 young, male black and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Am I stopping?"
And he said, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
In my research to this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent when they turned 17.
The last question I've said is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting that answer, "If you're a bit thinnerous, and the shiny hair is a little bit more beautiful, then you feel really happy and fab."
And we give backstage an answer that might be mediated by this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, I've never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure because every day I have to think about my appearance.
And if you ever ask, "I'd happier if I had thin legs and shiny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most spinny legs and the most glowing hair and the most cool dog poopy of it, and they're probably because of what their appearance might be, most insecure women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult for me to move a real balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to sit here and say, "I got all the benefits of a pile that was being sucked into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good for saying, "And that doesn't make me happy."
It was very difficult to reconcile a heritage of oppression and race when I'm one of the greatest benefileters of it.
But I'm also lucky and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great to get here before I've been there, 10 or 20, 30 years away, and my career has been more complete, because I probably wouldn't tell you how to get my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I paid college, which is so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk and hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our strange successes and failures.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who had come to life in exile, "Son, Laddafi's resistance. Let's hear the words.
But never, like a Gaddafi revolution will be."
It's been now almost two years since the Libyan revolution has been inspired by the waves of mass-counting in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I would join with many other Libyans, in and outside Slayens, to ask for a day of anger, and to launch a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadadhenis.
And there she was, a great revolution.
Boy, licensed women and men in the front row, demanded the end of the regime, held Slogans's freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've demonstrated some cutting-edge mutations by putting on the violent dictator of Gaddafis.
They showed a strong sense of solidarity from far from far from the far east to the far west, to the south.
After a period of six months of violent war and nearly 50,000 dead, we managed to free our country and to overrove the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a huge patron of the tyranny, the corruption, and the foundation of the change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regimes have destroyed both infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I firmly refer to how many other women, to rebuild civil society of Lybia, to our challenge was to have a publicized and sustained transition to democracy and national balance.
Near200 organizations, and as soon as Gaddafis was founded in Benghazi, we have nearly 300 to Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I began to organize workshops to the issues of capacity, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I set up the peacebuilding platform of Liby Indians, a movement of women, leaders of various different forms of life, whose goal is to stand up in public with sociopolitical empowerment for women and for our right-sexual rights with democracy and peacebuilding.
In the case of the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more polarized, an environment that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and its exclusion.
I was campaigning an initiative for the peacebuilding collection of women to be engaged in a control law, a law that would vote for every citizen, no matter what background to vote, and to vote for, and, above all, to create a change between political parties between male and female candidates on vertical scales and horizontal scales, and to make a complete consensus for a tag.
and we ended up being adopted and successful.
South Africa won 175 percent of the national bank worker in the first election since 52 years.
But slowly, the euphoria of elections and the whole revolution, after day, we started to have new messages of violence.
One morning, we entered the news of the nightmarging mosques of ancient mosques and Sufi champions.
Another morning, we got message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
After one morning, the wounded were signed by the army.
And indeed, every day, under the tyranny of the militias and their ongoing values against human rights prisoners and their defenses of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mental capacity, polarizing and distant from the ideals and principles -- freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they were at the beginning.
Intolerance, purpose and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our basic missionaries and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confess that as a nation, we have made false choices and wrong choices.
We have misbehared our priorities.
Because the elections did not bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Has the hard-loop and the change between women and male leaders bring peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate the political of dominance and endurance, both men and women?
Perhaps women were not the only people who missed it, but the female values of compassion, the gade and the seizure.
Our society needs a national dialogue and convergence as it needed to have its elections, which at the end has only increased the polarization and decisility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop being in the name of anger and demanding a day of revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the wade.
We need to develop a female discourse that will not only lead the values, but also to argue: evil instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, not an inclusion.
These are the ideals that need a war of razing lybia desperately to get peace.
Because peace has an alchemy and in this alchemy, it's about the inter-macating of feminine and masking view.
That's the real punch.
And we have to do that in every case before we do sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam" -- peace, "is the word of the Good God, Shiff."
The word "raemem" again known in all the late-discovery traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rahem" -- "in mother-in-law, symbolizes the motherly feminine, all of humanity, of the manhood and the female of all tribes that have been run away by all the peoples.
And just like the mother abdoco who grows in his life, completely surrounds the basic posture of compassion, of the existence.
And so we said, "My God's name always puts things in."
And so we said, "My God's name has pre-suppers before my penny."
and that may be the kind of a wade that we all think will be saved by.
Thank you.
When I was a little kid, I thought that my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with a song called "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we applied the story of Kim Il-Ilung, but we learned very little about the world out there, except America, South Korea and Japan are enemies.
And while I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until all that changes in a changing time.
At the age of seven, I saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer starvation.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter to a sister of a colleague of mine.
And she said, "If you were listening to this, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore, because we've been eating nothing since two weeks.
We're on the ground together, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people in my country had suffered.
Shortly after that, I went past the railway, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete anymore from my memory.
A squad drowned woman was lying on the ground, and a handheld kid in her arm smelled helplessly in the face of his mother.
And nobody helped them because they were all busy taking care of themselves and their families.
The mid-'99990s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were struggling to sacrifice the famine, and many others survived because they ate grass, beetles and forest corin.
Oilice has become more and more common so that at night, everything was darnily twisted for me, except for the lights of China to the other side of the transmitter that we were living on.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amroc, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very vested and enabled North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can tell you that while the devastating years of famine was sent to China to the relatives.
I was just thinking I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it took me 14 years to come together.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a North Korean refugee. But what I learned is that it's not only extremely difficult, it's also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly around, and you would be sending me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
And one day, I became the biggest nightmare ever, when I was caught by the Chinese police department and was sent to the police station.
Somebody accused me to be Northern Korean, so they tried my Chinese names and made me countless questions.
I was so afraid of that, I thought my heart would explode.
And there's anything unnatural coming out, and I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my feelings and answer the questions.
And after they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "That was a wrong thing.
She's not Northern Korean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
North Koreans in China, in foreign messages asylyl, but many of them are caught and threatened by the Chinese police.
Those girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released because of tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they're treasored to North Korea, where they're being executed, imprisoned or publicly executed.
Even though I was lucky enough to be able to do it, many other North Koreans did not.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
and after learning a new language and finding work, their world can be turned upside down at a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was going to leave South Korea, a bigger challenge, than I thought I would have.
English was so important in South Korea, that I had to start my third language.
I also realized the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very divergent from this, due to 67 years.
I went through a survivor.
Am I South or Northstorean?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life was not easy for me, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording following at the university.
Just as I became more normal in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities began to send the money that I was sending my family, and as punishment, my family forced to rely to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to their way to free.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, and ironically, I took a trip back to China and made me go to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles across China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got nearly several times caught.
Once, when the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the speculation of all of them, and he started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official promised my family, I decided to and told him that they were greens, and I was her bossy.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get to the Portuguese border, but I had to almost rush my money to get the borderline of Laos to clear.
But even after we had crossed the border, my family was imprisoned, because of illegal border crossing.
After spending money and drinking cash, my family was released in a month, but only after that, my family was revered back to the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest reposition of my life.
I had done everything to avoid my family for freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Korean embassy.
I went and went between the immigrant agency and the police department, trying to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for cash or cash money.
I lost all my hope.
And the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that one foreign is going to care about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without hunting, he went to a benchrant, and they paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him, and I was really passionate about him, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"Don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The former outsiders, for me, symbolized a new hope that required to have the North Koreans so desperately, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans need.
After our long journey, my family and I, again, united in South Korea, but the freedom to gain is only one step.
North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start off with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn to learn in education, in the classroom, in the professional education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family support, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so lucky to have so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make hopeful North Koreans success with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, even on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
He divides them, and he divides them, and he divides them.
He's not greedy. He doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine himself: he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to speak of words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate franchol, but he remembers the release of every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, while the first result of the Teletoon was pounding on my arm, and Grand Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't they listen?
A lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit in the social version of normal, they're often overdated and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul empowered was that although that was the case, even though they were not considered normal, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affects social communication that affects learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's different than the one individual in each individual, and that's Remi as different as Sam.
And the world's been finding every 20 minutes of a new person with autism, and while it's one of the fastest growing diseases of the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been faced autism, but I can't remember it every day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He screamed a lot.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and set his own world in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy on the tiniest things, like cars, in a row of space, tying the washing machine and eating everything that was behind him.
And as he got older, he became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the deficiency and the never-ending hyperactivity was something that was really unique: an ordinary and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any biases, a human who had never suffered.
Extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I would not want to trade against normality.
Normalality is the beauty that makes us see the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! We each have a gift in it. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress, and change dies at the moment we try to be somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
And Doc Edgerton has been enjoying us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph on a project of a apple and a unit of radiation from a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world as a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new imaging technology that's so fast that it can create slow-motion images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look out at the outside of our area, or without any <unk>-rays in our bodies, and really ask what we mean with the camera.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and turn it in a one-to-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-a-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-four-day laser, I'm making a multi-through-through-through
So, when you take this project called this photons pack and put it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break in that bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, think of this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanosecond -- so long as the light to go back this track -- but I'm trying to slow this video by factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon dish, starts moving through it, and eventually breaks into the inside.
A part of the light comes out onto the table, and you see that spread of waves.
and many of the photons eventually reach the shock of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's streaming around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the glass are focused on some images at the end.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back and take the same distance and slow the video back to 10 billion times, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
Day one week? No! One year, one year.
That would be a very boring movie -- -- from a slow, normal projectile in motion.
And what about a little more still life photographer?
You can see again, these waves streaming the table, the Tomate and the wall in the background.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It seemed like nature was painting this picture, one photo, one Memto image, but of course our eye looks a collient image.
But if you look at these Tomreets again, you'll see that when the lights are streaming over the eaves, they're going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomrow is mature, and the light is jumping around it, and after a few hundred seconds, it's coming back.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your camera in a Camerahandy, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if an fruit is mature without touching it at all.
So how did my team build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of a short-term radiation, you have very little light, but we compose a billion times faster than the shortest air age, so you're going to get the same as zero light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project called this photon pack, this photons pack, and we're drawing it again, a million times, with very clever synchrony, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make this fonemite video that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do some very interesting things.
All right, so Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future supercomputer: can we see corners?
And the idea is that we're lighting a light on the door.
It's going to be crushing into the room, some of that's going to bounce back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use that increase of extra mix of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left side you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden in a puppet, and we're going to shut the light off of the door.
After our case of paper was published in the UNature Communications, it was made from Nature.com, and they created these animation.
We're going to chop up this light project, and we're going to put it on this wall, and this photons pack will be clustered back in all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup, that will break the light, and then reflect the door of a part of the light of the light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but the most interesting times, they're going to be able to be able
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-solving solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point to distance.
By lighting a laser, we can take a raw image of that -- how they look on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we pick up many of these images, dozens of these images, and we put them together and try to analyze the different light tubes, we can see that hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a lot to do before we can apply that to the lab to practice, we could build cars that avoid collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for survivors of survivors by looking at light reflected through open windows, or we can build endlessly built in the body deep to see the right thing around the Ok Caroxo and Kocope.
But of course, because of the blood and tissue, that's very challenging, and that's really a wake-up call for scientists, is to think about Femto photographer, because a new imaging tool could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as a genome has been turned into Docton, even a scientist, is a art that has become an art of the ultra-first-first photography, and I realized that all this terabyte of data we're collecting every time, not just for the scientific process. We can also create a new form of computer photography, with the color and with the lightbulvopes, and we can't even look at those waves between those angles of time.
But here's what happens. It's also a funny thing.
If you look at those waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost recording light speed, having strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The sequence of what's happening in the world will appear in the light sequence of the camera in a second order, by applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So, whether it's photography around, or making a new imaging framework for medicine or new forms of reference, since we've made all the data open to our website and hope that the "compensators are creative and the research community that we should stop us from taking the megapotars and setting the answers to the next dimension, and to start to respond to the next dimension.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with our people.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many teaching disabilities are not passed, but we use the same public space.
Over the past few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and scammates and crosses.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without disturbing each other?
How can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the quiet houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being reassured by the huge neglie that for hundreds of years, lovers and garages and shafts and shade. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time somebody ever saw it in New Orleans, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most abandoned parts of America.
I live near this house, and I thought, how can I get it, and I thought about something that has changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me, and her death suddenly came along and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it brought me a lot of clarity on the things that I've been in my life right now.
But I'm not afraid of keeping that view every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giant board and I wrote a Scagon in the gaps, "On me die, I want to die," everyone who can come, take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I was expecting to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely crowded, and it grew and grew.
I want to share some sentences with you, written by the people on the wall.
"I'd die before." I want to be sued for piracy."
"I wish I'd die before, I want to stand on a broad-term date line of International Crisis."
"I wish I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'd die before." I want to plant a tree."
"I wish I'd die before."
"I wish I die, I want to keep it in my arms again."
"I wish I'd die, I want to be a chapcavic."
"I wish I die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people took me to laugh and to tears and to hate me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and obvious way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what we most care about as we grow and change.
I did this last year and I received hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction kit and became a local company in countries like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have when we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices with others.
And the two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often held up by talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that strengthens us.
The idea of death makes us feel life.
Our common places are the best of what makes us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, to share our fears and stories, the people around us can not just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm involved in aggressive mathematics. A special problem for anyone who's been involved in disgusted mathematics is that we're like business consulters.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try today to tell you what I do.
Smiling is one of the most human activity.
We are thrilled to look at the secretary ballet duts and traders, as you'll see in the moment.
The ballet may be an extraordinarily large amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental repository that a genetic component might have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's has slowly destroyed this extraordinary capacity, and that's what it does to me in my congressors, the people who were on the day, was a ballet abysmal.
Over the years, we've been making a lot of progress in treatment.
Still, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer this disease, and they have to live with the impossible symptoms like weakness, death, sin, parath, and other things that cause that disease to happen, so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We have to measure the progress objective, and ultimately the only way to know if there's a cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there's no biomarker in the brain, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing there is, like, 20 minutes-of-minute test on the neurologist.
You have to run it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means beyond clinical trials never done. Never ever.
But what if patients could do that test at home?
That would make a scourge tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have a working hospital.
It costs 300 percent to study yourself in the neurological unit, by the way.
And so I want to suggest to you that an unconventional way that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a certain sense, virtual impenuction like I've heard of Jander Stripling.
This is a video of the vibrating vocal rings.
This is what happens in the normal state when someone created speech sounds. We can look at the coherent ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we've created sound, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And like ballet, it takes a lot of work.
Think about how long a child it takes to learn to speak.
By the way that we can adjust the position of vibrating vocal sounds, and just like the limbs are also the mood organs of Parkinson's disease.
On the lower record, you can see an example of the irregular vocal evidence of the evidence.
We see the same symptoms.
Bad and weakness, rusic.
The language is sometimes more blurry and white, and that's an example of the same thing.
This impacts on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and opposite-replication software, combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, we can now find exactly where someone is in a spon between disease and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
So how can we measure these testing with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
Very little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both of these are accurate. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very fast, at the most, 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If it's something extremely cheap, you can use it in a very large scale.
So these amazing goals can be achieved here.
We can reduce logistics problems for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data by expanding observations.
We can do low-cost mass support for clinical trials for clinical trials and have the first time to do it for the first time in the entire population.
We now have the possibility to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're taking the first step in this direction, we start the Parkinson's voice in the U.S. Prostitution.
With Aculab and patient bike, we want to take a very high number of voices worldwide to have enough initial data to deliver those goals.
We have a quadruple of minute-to-a-half people on this planet.
Anybody with no Parkinson's disease can call for a while to pass a few cents, and I'll be known to say that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of it, say, 10,000 people, can you tell who's healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to be told during the phone call, whether this person has Parkinson's disease or not, OK.
Some of them may not be able to finish them.
But what we do is we collect a huge database of what's interesting in different circumstances, and that's the circumstances that we're important to choose to deliver that into the event of what the actual markers are for Parkinson's.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is right?
It's much better.
My students, Thanasis -- I have to put it all up because he's done such fantastic work -- has shown that it's also working on the cellular network, which is enabling this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call an improvement.
That is, people can -- people can call up their phone and they can do the test. People could call with Parkinson's, they can let their voice, so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see my father's cows behind the kitchenline is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the South, is found in its area. That means that wildlife such as zebras can leave the park any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night, and I woke up in the morning, and she found her dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the central of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and the heavens, and that's why our animals mean so much to us.
Even as a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our treasures. They're also held for this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years old is responsible for his father. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that would not really help us, but helping the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on going.
I had a second idea. I tried a bird-crow.
I wanted the lions to think I was next to the cow shed.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird gait, you go back to the next time, but you come back and you say, this thing doesn't move, it's still here.
and they reach and kill our livestock.
One night, I tweetted the stall, I walked around with a torch, and this time the lions didn't catch.
And the lion is afraid of light that's moving.
I had an idea.
I was working in my room as a young boy, and I once took the new radio of my mother, and the day it almost took me around. But I learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a power-in-cangering machine out of a motorcycle, and that shows if you want to turn to the right or left. It blinks.
And I made a switch to turn the lights in and off.
This is a little pam lamp out of a broken flashlight.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel invites the battery, provides the electricity to the correct power. I call it a transformer.
And the air response is flashing.
You can see that the pearls show outward because of where the lions come from.
And this is what the lions look like when they come.
The lights flashing, and the lions believe I'm going around the stour, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been installing this in our home, and since then, we have no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
And I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're working really well.
Now, my idea is used in all of Kenya, including for other predators like fire or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and help with fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in, and we put the lights where there are no one, and I'm showing the people how to use them.
One year ago, I was just a guy from the savanna who was washing his cows, and I was watching planes above me, and I was like, "I'm going to sit in one!"
And here I am.
I was allowed to train with an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm tall, I want to be an airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to be singing. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and the lions. We can live side by side with lions without any argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electric inventions.
What's the next thing on the list?
So my next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An electrocon fence?
Yes, I know that electrical fences have long invented, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- Yeah, I tried this before, but I gave myself a break again, because I got a shot.
The very beginning is heavy. Richard Turer, you're something special.
We're going to hire you every step of your walk, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you my 15 favorite pictures, and I didn't just do one of them.
There was no sort of executive, no style, no chance of taking a picture, not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by accidental tourists.
My story starts as a speech in New York, and my wife took this picture, where I hold my daughter on my first birthday, my arm. We were at the corner of 57ster and 5s.
A year later, we were back in New York, so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where that's going from, you know, what is going on?
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you go to Sabina to New York and make a father's daughter's daughter's Day, to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking for tourists to come and take a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a blank stranger, your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and thankfully, nobody has ever called anyone with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel spaces would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred to us.
This was only a week since 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened that day, so that five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a hidden moment, or a specific journey.
It's also a possibility for us to take a week in October, to keep time and change the time we've been from year to year, not just physically, but in everything.
Because while we always make the same picture, our perspective changes as it goes by time, as it always reaches new milestone, I can see life with its eyes, as they interact with everything and what it sees.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect every year.
Well, while one of our trips we walked, we walked for a while, and suddenly they're bouncing like this, and it shows a red tray at a dollhouse where they had learned as a little kid, at the previous age of travel.
And she told me about her feelings of being a five-year-old child, who had been choosing at that point.
She said that she remembered her heart coming from the chest when she first saw the store for the first nine years ago.
And now she looks in New York at high schools because she wants to study in New York.
And I realized that obviously, the most important thing we're all creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious memory of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 images, I'm hardly a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image, and please not ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 26.73, 57.5/34.1/21.9/14.1 (BP=0.959, ration=0.960)
