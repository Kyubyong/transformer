When I was 11 years old, I was struck by the sounds of the night in one morning.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He was very happy at what was unusual at the time, because he was very angry.
He said, "The Taliban's gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning I'm never going to forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban put the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was so upset for five years as a boy and I was in my older sister who had not been allowed to be alone to be a secret school.
It was the only way we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way that nobody could guess where we were going.
We're just looking at our books in shopping bags so it looks like we'd just go out of a car.
We've been in a house with 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was kind of a nasty thing, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risked: teachers and our parents.
And then, all the class had to fall out for a week because the Taliban had stopped.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are you going to succeed?
Do you know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and daughters were important.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreignist from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he was on his daughter -- my mother -- and was sent to school, and was defending by his father.
My mother was a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's the first one in his family who ever received a education.
It was always clear that his kids would have a training, but also his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk to send his kids to school.
I still know that in the years, I was so frustrated in the Taliban, sometimes, of our lives, of the constant fear and the perspective of immissity.
I had a good joke to give up, but my father said, "Told, please, I can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be thrown out of your house.
But one thing you're going to stay, that's what's in there. And even if we have to pay attention to your lunch, we're going to be done.
So -- do you want to give me any more?"
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed in decades of war.
Less than six percent of women have a higher degree in my age than the high-fist degree, and if my family had not been so much, my education would have been my education, I would have a woman.
Instead, I stand here today as a proudly uninventant of the Middle York College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was released from his family because he was paying his daughters to school one of the first who was defending me.
He's not just talking about my graduate degree, but also that I was the first woman who runs him on the car with the car of Kabul.
My family thinks to me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've been able to start to start the first, SOLA, and maybe the only Internet for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school teacher is still less likely to do.
It's a wonderful way to see how the students in my school are going to be with great ambition to all of them.
And to see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as my parents, despite all the time, and against all the discomfort.
As Ahmedabad. That's not really his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of a student.
Until a month, his daughter and he was on the front of the LongLA in her village, and she's been killed by a bomb on the side of the road just to get away for a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone was flying, and a voice was flended, if he sent his daughter back to school, she would try it again.
And he said, "Tow me now, if you want to, I'm not going to put the future on the game for your old-fashioned and preconceived ideas."
In Afghanistan, as I realized something that is often going to be reported in the West, the majority of us have succeeded, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realize that their success is also success.
It's not to say that our mothers don't have a big role in our success.
They're often very likely to be aware of the fact that they're already looking at a lot of the most compelling future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely unaware of.
The Taliban just went for a few hundred girls to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls, the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be looking like America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long, and they're changing the world's population again.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is one country for me, and the hope of hope and the unconvencted possibilities, and remember the girl who's visited the LongLA every day.
Just like I have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, but I was a young life -- I've been shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 -- I look young -- I'm not -- but I've been in Zambia, Kenya, I've been working at the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia in the projects of the technical collaboration with African countries.
I've worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we've given on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I think 21 years ago, we're good at Italy and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
So our first project, which was inspired by the first book of "Rurt" in Zam Abbe, was one where we wanted to show the people of Italy to be formed in the Sambiqueia,
We came to Italian seed in South Zambia, and we got to this up to the edge of the valley, which is what the Sami River is doing. We taught the local population of the Japanese and Cobm ...
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to look at them.
And we were amazed that there was no such a cold valley.
But instead of asking why they're not built for us, we just said, "Thank God, that's where we are!"
"Mear time in time to save the people of Sambias before the star."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this super-social soup in Italy, and they were so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato bubble was red, about 200 pores of the river were coming from the river and everything.
We said to the Sambins, "Oh God, the nodous!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you say this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought that we were so great about Italy in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French did, after I saw what she did, I was proud of our project in Zambia.
We were actually putting the rod.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we have in our non-linear world.
You should read the book "Dead Aid Aid A to Casa Moyo, she's a traditional economic scientist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent a trillion trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has taken.
Just read your book.
You know, reading from a African, what we've done was?
We're Western people's imperialists, colonialists, missionists, and there are only two ways we deal with people, and we're talking to them, we're a patriotic.
Both words come from the Latin root root of the "bater," which means "pather."
But they have two different meanings.
Religicalism: I'm all myself in another culture as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm all holding up another culture as if they were my granddad.
So the white people in Africa are called "Deir, Charner,"
I was shocked when I read the book "Sally Beyy" by the time he said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, they'd go back.
That's the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
Now this conference was coming out of the road tomorrow, and this conference opened up, and said, "Can you imagine a city that is not a neololic colonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I decided to be a system called a company where never gets to do something, but you will be motivated to the service of the local talent, the local man who have a better dream.
What you do -- you keep the mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you're going to sit together with the local community.
We're not working on offices.
We meet ourselves in cafeteria. We meet ourselves in Kip.
We have no infrastructure.
We close to kindness and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can convey someone a idea.
If that person doesn't like what you're supposed to do?
The passion for its own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for its own grown is the most important thing of humanity.
We help them find the knowledge because nobody can be successful.
The person who has the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Now, many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? Not in community collections?
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have to say that entrepreneurs never will have to say you're going to be in public with what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
So, you have to have that eye.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never seem to be in public meetings.
We're working on one to do this, and we have to do it, and we have to make a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job that has to be created.
This is the house of the company, the hospital of the company who is sitting in your house with you in your kitchen and the cafe helps you find the tools to change your passion in a way that is going to lead to life.
I tried this in Belter, West Abart.
I was working on the time, and I tried to get the unhried, where we say other things to do what they're supposed to do.
And so I went through the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, I helped him, and I helped him in a garage, he was Maiii, and I helped him to go to a restaurant in a mosque, and then the fishermen came up and said, "You'd help me?"
I helped this five fish, and we were working together and not selling this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents a.<unk>amp;K.<unk>amp; but to Japanese for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped us?"
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do that?" I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I feel the mouth and I hear them."
So -- So -- So the government says, "Do you want it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped over 40,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be on with loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business manager of history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was working with companies. Peter said, "Rield is actually unaware of a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So planning is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you create Christchill, without knowing what the smartest human Christchchas want to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to come up to one.
You have to offer them arguments and privacy. You have to be great at them, and they will come up.
In a community of 10,000 people, we'll get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who have intelligence and passion?
What are you doing for the most of you today?
"Hear, passionate people. You've got excellent.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-fancing fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn machine is not sustainable.
The free of the non-violent, is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, we can build and make them with them.
The technologies don't exist for this.
Who is going to invent this technology for the green revolution? Are universities? Are you?
The government? Do you forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're now.
I read a great story in a pre-existic magazine for many years.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860.
In 180, they came together and they were specified, which would happen in 100 years ago with the city of New York. The conclusion was a popular: The New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? You're looking at the curve and said, if the population grows in this speed, they needed six million horses to get people to do it, and it's impossible to get off with the dung of six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
In 180, they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there was 1001 automators in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology, the race had made, and there was little little factories in the back of theland.
So, Divin Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered to them.
They don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate services.
You have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, all of us have to do is to sell three things: to sell the product, the market market has to be great and financialization.
You guess what?
We never met a single person who's going to produce something at the same time, and they're going to take care of the money.
That's not what it's happening.
This person never was born.
We've been doing research and we've looked at the 100 most idiese companies in the world -- Carnegie Wouses, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies have in the world have, just one: no one was founded by one person.
Now, we teach 16 year-old entrepreneurship, and we start teaching the class to give them two sides of Richard Bransicsography. The task is the first 16-year-old, in the first two sides of Richard Spizian Screen, as often as the word "s" and the word "s" as often as a word.
Never Again, 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small developer in cafeteria and Bars, and their partner to do what someone has done for this gentleman who's been talking about this gentleman who's talking about the Eman, who says, "What do you need to be?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, so you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you think I'm a guy for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support the company for the people to find the tools and people, and we found that the miracles of the local population, that culture can change the culture of this community, only by the passion of the world, of the power of their human.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it's supposed to be, Alice's,
Now, Penn State University asked me -- a <unk> a CEO for communication -- to exchange engineers in communication.
I was scared.
Be aware of these students with their big brains and their large books and their big ones, I don't trust me.
But when the conversation evolved, he made me look like Alice, when she was walking down to the mouse, and a door looked at a new world.
I felt like I was talking to the students with the students, and I was amazed about the thoughts that they had, and I wanted others to find this miracleland.
I think to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication to change our scientists and engineers.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the ones that are our biggest problems, for example, about energy and health, and if we don't know about it, we don't understand it, then it's not going to go ahead. I think it's not going to be in our responsibility as a non-course.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please, please.
I want to show you a few ways of how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy with you, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, and what?
So let's tell us why this is just so relevant to your scientific field.
It's not just that you're looking at their feathers, but it also tells us that their swelly structure in our bones, because it's important to study oosis and treat.
And if you describe what you do, then you're going to have preventable dictionaries.
Now, the myth is a obstacle to your mind.
I'm sure you could use your <unk>-ray and time<unk> but why don't you just say "design" and time," what is much more obvious for us?
We're not just trying to understand your thoughts, it's not the same as the same way to turn off their level.
As Einstein said, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can tell something about your scientific field without having to deal with compromise.
Some of the things are about to think about: examples, stories and analogies. So this way you can take you into your bag.
And if you put your work, then let's get the points away.
Have you ever asked why it's the point?
What happens when someone is going to be over? Another one is just weeks, and with these points, your audience is your first.
So, as a slide like this, it's not just boring, but it's also too much about the work-making part of our brain, and that's how we're focused on it.
This is a proxy of Geneva, which is much more effective, and it shows that the special structure of the feine is so stable that it actually was the inspiration of the original design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single sentence, just to use a single sentence that you can lose the audience once it gets to the thread, it can be a little bit more and it also leads our other senses to the sense of what it is.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up these door and see the miracles of the science and the technology that we've been talking about.
And the engineers that I taught, I taught to make up with the "N" in a narrow, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
So, look at your science and your text, and your writing word "crity" is going through the Recept," and so the audience says what's important and multiply the whole thing that you have with your passion, and that is how you can have this incredible, and that you can be completely different from the new complexity.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I really love to be.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human field in Syria.
You can run a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get it up to sound-Cloud and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in the time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to change in the street and showed them.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're asking all these people who have been collected and asking change, a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Do you mind your cell phone high, keep them up?
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everyone has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 358 lines full of information.
Pell data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. is a straight line.
This is a rule called the law line for the banking supply.
Now the line is that every telephone company in Europe has to store every Internet service in the entire Europe, a range of users in the entire Europe.
Who is going to call? Who is the email?
Who is going to send a text?
And when you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet phone.
And everywhere in Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want to do that."
They said, we want to not to be able to do this trade supply.
We want to be self-expiving in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all of these information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to do that."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people went on the streets of Berlin and say, "Take fear instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be on the valley 2.0
The Stower was the head-in-in-in-in-domen in easternland.
And I wonder if that really works.
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Degraph, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, I ask all the information that you've collected me.
And I asked her, and I asked her again, and I had no answer. Just a little blue light.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, it's her calendar.
So I decided to put a court trial against them because I wanted to have this information.
But the <unk>Ph. telegraph said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to go back to what they'd send me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court decided that the introduction of the E.S. is the German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown, brown leap with a CD.
And on the CD, this is what it was.
3580.30 lines of information.
I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge date. My hand.
But I realized this for a while. This is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I want to start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, I'm sleeping what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what's called the stock supply system.
So with time and open data, I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and go back and forth.
You can go one step that I do, go ahead.
And you can see, you can see how I'm driving on the train with a sandp oil, and how many calls I'm doing on the road.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I call my wife and calls me and we talk a few times.
And then I'll call you a couple of friends and they'll call each other.
And after a while, you call you and call you, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other when they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who is the leader of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who you are talking to who someone is listening to a email, all of that is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we'd imagine that all of these people in the streets in the streets of 1989, had had had had had cell phones in their pocket.
And the singingers knew who was at the demonstration of this, and when the roseers knew who the leaders were, that would probably never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall would have not happened.
And that's not the case of the iron curtain.
Because the state agency and companies are trying to store so many information about how they can get us from us, online and online.
You want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But self-confidence and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
You have to fight for that every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not the old age.
If you go home, you say your representative, because companies and state have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company to get the information you've lost on it.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight the self-interest in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central. The round-bat soup, rapid restaurants, the Brack.
So the city map is moving, and so I realized the name of Central Central to change it for something else, it changed it in South Los Angeles, or if something changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Souncy stores, rapid restaurants, the tid.
Like 26,2 million Americans, I live in the food city of Central Los Angeles, the home of the Dr. HeForShe and the Dr.
The com is that the Dr. Deverus is killing more people than the Driveyys.
You're dying in South Central Los Angeles from unenable diseases.
Now, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than at Beverly Hills, about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really get that.
And I wondered how you would feel when you had no access to food, if you go out of the house, the negative effects that have had on your neighborhood.
I've been able to buy the Rolls and sell as a traffic supply.
I see the conversation centers running up like Starbucks.
And I realized that that's going to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have any funny at about a 40-minute age to get a apple that is not under the pesticide.
So I planted a food hot atmosphere before my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park park.
It's 45 feet. It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it in the way."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and I got the guy, the L.A. Green Beowers, and we started planting my food and fruit, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a professional group, we're putting together all the different layers and all the city, and it's totally voluntary and everything we do, and everything we do, free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else is worried.
The city came to me and he gave me an extraction, and he said that I had to get rid of my garden, and the wheel was a legal configuration.
And I thought, "Kuh, come on, right?
A set of rules for growing food on a piece of land that you're not really different?
And I thought, "Cool. Her name."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lzz made a story about the city and talked to a member of Green Ground Zero. She gave a petition on Chau.org and we succeeded.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My city even called and said that they support and love what we do.
So, why don't they do that?
LA. There's the most of the open-up spaces in the United States.
They have a 67-mile-mile-foot-foot-up.
This is 20 Central Park.
That's enough to plant 725 million tomato cells.
Why is it that they shouldn't find it okay?
And you get 1,000 seeds to the crop.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the cost of 75 dollars.
It's my boss driver's empowerment, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
It's like to grow up its own food as your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in Central Central Central.
I grew up there. I've raised my sons there.
And I feel more, part of this preconial reality that was made by other people, and I've made my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
I'm a graffiti. I'm putting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm putting lawns and park.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants are my skles for these things.
You might be surprised what the ground is possible if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunshine is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was a instrument for education and the transformation of my quarter.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're on the ground.
You'd wonder how children are influenced by that.
So, I'm sure that the therapeutic and the most cool act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can get more strawbers.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came out of 10 o'clock in the morning. They were in my backyard, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said to them, "You don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that made me just the most important thing to do. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "In the Devil is, no, I'm not afraid that they're looking at what's going on.
But it's the road.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time I want them to take care of their health."
I put a garden in this homeless house in D.A.
These are the guys that helped me to get the stage.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it's changed for a moment.
Green Grich has already planted about 20 gardens.
We had this 50 people, and they were all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow out of tomato soup, they eat tomato soup.
But if they're not offered anything, if they're not shown, how food and bodies affect, they're blindly blindly, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're in this thing -- I see color kids who are just on the path that they're already about, and they're not going to get anywhere.
The way I see this is a chance that we can train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a shipboard and turn them into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-pug, because free is not sustainable.
The comry of sustainability is that you have to stop them.
I'm talking about giving people work and children from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy and the pride that you're going to meet when you build your own food, and when you open up farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want you to become all the ecological rebels, the gang, the gang-hullers.
We have to turn the picture of the ganglight.
If you're not a carpist, you're not a gang.
You're going to have a great deal with a dier, right?
And let's get the gun to your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me in a nutshack, when you want to sit in a meeting where you talk about it, some of them will be.
If you want to meet me, come up with your shuffle, in my backyard, so we can plant some of these pots.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "nollyyyid."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "nnantidary" means "nonless politicians."
In the 19th century, a newspaper party was a better definition: "A Snolly Hooly's a guy who is in a foreign office, independent of the page or post-page, and successed its success of the propulsion."
I have no idea what a workshop is.
I think about it, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to control language.
171, for example, the British parliament had been sent to the news of Russian Parliament, not the exact word "The Replamous" in the front of the news.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name Killby, who was involved with Parliament.
And she put him in the mountain of London and he gave him a man, but he was courageous enough to stop, and eventually he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first one for the sentence "Book" as well as many people believe.
Bretty is on the English word for a bike.
But that's not true. It's going back to a failure of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are wired, I want to take you to the United States at the time they've just reached independence.
You're looking at the question of how you call George Washington, the state of America.
You didn't know.
What do you call a complete nation?
It's been reported in Congress for infinite debate.
And there were all sorts of things that there were.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the governor Washington, and others, his greatness George Washington, and again, the free freedom of the people of the United States of America.
Not so much.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that's a failure.
They were not monarchistist, they wanted to vote for the king for a certain period.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored in the conversation, because this debate was three weeks.
I read the days of a news book that's always writing: "I've got the same subject.
The reason for the crash was to be angry and the long time was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want him.
The king, and maybe it's even for the ideas that he's going to give.
They wanted to give him the most, most enjoyable title that they could give.
This title was "Puning"
You didn't invent the title. He didn't have before. But he just meant that someone had a set of documents.
It's kind of like the failure of a quot.
He had no longer the size as the "Ass" or "Aatal."
There were times of the president of small colonial institutions and government groups, but it was actually a unrained title.
That's why he refused to get him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up and meet foreign-dirles.
Who is going to take him seriously when he has a stupid title like the president of America?
And after three weeks, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, you're not supposed to use this "The Unra"" word "The name" by first, but they'd be absolutely clear that they'd be honest about the ideas of the past and civilized nations, whether it's the state of the world, that it's not worth the world.
You can learn three interesting things.
One is -- and I think that's the best -- I can't find out if the Senate ever has signed the title of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been the title of a beloved name. He just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says that something is temporary -- you're going to wait 223 years later.
And third, and that's really important, is that the most important point is that the title of the United States today is not so painful, right?
It's something that has to do with a little bit more than 5,000-fived shark that he has and the largest economy in the world and a drone drone and all of that stuff.
and reality has given the title of the size.
And that's how the Senate won at the end.
They have a respect title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the head of self-esteem -- now it was.
You know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear war accidents and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, the representative hospital lost, because nobody feels a bit more, if you're told you're now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take you, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but actually the reality changes much more than words that could ever change the reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a bar with about 50 degrees to fight to Mount Graalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I was looking at my black Conclin on a pair of brown leather and a bakery in the direction of the government of the first, I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been on the war for a long time, but at the end of the mountain, we'd be playing Pyjama and football and singing with a rapper with a local-state conflict and the Interconial protesters who never lived with the communist and the country, and I knew what the point was.
But that's the geography of self.
So I'm standing here, I've got a very privileged B<unk>aeda, South nations of God's "Ajood" and a radically radical artist who lived the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So, there are plenty of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about the art, but I don't like to paint rain-like songs. I want to make art, and I want to fill the personality and authority and re-cuse the reality and the reality, and even a more sophisticated imagination to make the world that we live.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- a great one that is going to have the jihad of jihad, like <unk>amp;D<unk>s<unk>s, and armed with religious disbelief and political corruption.
And what else can make the jihad-woo than to get the parliament and a choice campaign with the slogan: "Do I'll be a name! I'm a rich."
And to use this campaign to allow these maiosi to kill the people who spend their own as a national.
I want to go to the corruption of Afghanistan to the reason, with a project called "Rearing," where you take a stop-up, a false control on the street on the street and cars, instead of a tax, instead of taking money from them, and they're going to give them money to the police of Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become in the Cultural conflict.
The war and the religious views that came with him, have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, I founded in a local rodent with a non-controquic, a non-expicial, a neonic, a neonic, a neonic.
And I'd like to see how a simple slick of Kabul looks like a little bit of a pellow of 183 to create a dialogue about this today's development of development in the last-century history of the "The Monarchy" of the black man, maybe a little bit of the black man or even a new.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misconrect.
But I do, because I have to, because I have to have to, because the geography of self is supposed to.
That's my burden. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
I said, for 10 years, that's exactly what I said.
I feel like this is now built in the room a unconditional tension, because I had to have no clothes.
I'm lucky enough to get a little bit of the way to the world.
This is the first time that somebody is running to the TED stage, so you can appreciate it, I think.
If a few women were really pissed up when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I read on Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm a pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds of what you think about me.
It doesn't have any chance.
These are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them at all.
The most difficult part is to pull the swear over my head, because you'll all be struck by me, so you're not doing anything, as long as he's on my head.
Okay.
Why did I do that now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not so embarrassing as this picture.
So a picture is powerful, but a picture is also a superficial.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should give my back oil and my hand into the hair.
And besides the surgery or the wrong clocks that I've been doing two days ago, we've only got very few ways to change our fears, and our "em" -- although even the surface is unconuous, a big impact on our lives.
Unless to be honest is to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and I call this a sexy girl.
Now, I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but at the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery, and maybe ask you what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we've not only defined beauty as well and young and symmetrical, in which we're programmed to be biologically, but also as big, feminine and bright.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's taken for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this, and maybe some kind of fashion calls, "Hugomi, Tyra, Tyra. Joan Woy.
And I'm just talking about the model of your knowledge. Very impressive.
But I'm afraid that in 2007, we have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student, all the way that I did, each one of them, has been executed, and that 6700,000 of them didn't know.
The next question that's always going to be asked is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you this little girl is, why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can become President of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja-in-law, which was completely wrong, because you would be the first one."
If they say to me about this great line, "No, no, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who is my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American bird or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisis.
And to say, you're going to want to be a model later, as if you'd say you'd want to win the Jack in the serif.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of model knowledge, because when you're a heart surgeon, it can only be seen.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Con, we want to run a photo in the house first, and the leg is beautiful, and then on the back of the back, the back of the head is moved, you're moving back to the side, and you just look back, and you're going to see 300 and you're going to see it.
It looks like this.
I hope that I'm sure that I'm going to be less weird than that.
That's -- I don't know what happened.
If you finished school and you've done a life cycle, and you're not afraid of that, you're going to say that you want to be president of the United States, but you're looking at "10 years." You'll be looking at weird."
The next question that I've been asked to say is, "Who's the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much, all the photos are stored, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first picture I've done, and that was the very first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have the time.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
I just saw a few months before with my grandmother.
This is me on the day of this song.
My friend had to come up with me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a song for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not mine.
They're designs, and they're a group of professionalists, from Harus and make-up artists and photographers and photographers and all their assistants and their post-preaters and the production strategy. That's not me.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "Do you have things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot-m-bots that I never wear, but the things I'm making free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the clothes for free.
When I was a teenager, I drove with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and they were on a red light, and of course we were stopped, and it just took me, "Excuse me, Mr. Reag," and we could go on.
I've got this costless thing because of what it looks like, and I don't have people who look for their appearance and not pay attention to their personality a high price.
I live in New York, and the 140,000 teenagers who were stopped last year and shot up, 85 percent of black and Latino often young men.
It's about 17,000 young young young young men and black-American who are not asking the question: Who was I going to stop?
"How often am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
In my research, I found that 53 percent of our entire 12-year-old girls don't like their body, and this number goes up to 78 percent when they've become 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thin, and you've got a little pink hair, then you're feeling very happy and amazing."
And we give a answer that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
It's true, but it's just half of the story, because we never tell you what I never said before the camera, "I feel insecure."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about what my view is every day.
And if you ever ask, "Do I happier if I had thin legs and bright hair?"
And I want you to meet some models because they have the thin legs and the most cool hair and the cool flam, and they're the same thing about their appearance, probably the most dangerous women on the planet.
And when I prepared this talk, it seemed very difficult to get me to a honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to say this one, and I got all the benefits from a stack that was forced to the juice, and it doesn't seem very good."
It was very difficult to use a legacy of oppression, against race, when I'm one of the largest use of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great to be here before I've done 10 or 30 years of career, because I wouldn't say that I would probably not tell my first job, or I would have been told what's so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully, we'll hope that all of us have the power of the image in our preferences and misfort.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who had come to life in the exroat, "Son, Lafi's Chafi resistance.
But never will be something like a Gafafi revolution."
It's already two years since the Fromian revolution, inspired by the waves of mass-pighs and both in the Islamic Revolution.
I connected myself to many other savannas, and in a way, to challenge a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyris of the Copernican regime.
And there was a big revolution.
Boy, Frew and men were in the first row, and the end of the regime, gave the freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've demonstrated an unusual courage by putting it against the brutal dictator of Gafafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from far beyond the farest West, until the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of war and almost 50,000 dead deaths, we made our country free and the tyrant.
Now, Gafi has left a great burden, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation of the course.
Over the course of four decades, Gafzis's Prince Gris regime has destroyed both infrastructure, and the moral structure of the ly-like society.
The devastation and the challenges, I've known as many other women to build civilia back again, and we asked a propulsion and unorganized transition to democracy.
Now, to the top of 200 organizations, and at the same time, the Gaddafis founded in Benghaz, almost 300 to Tripolis.
After 33 years of the exil, I came back to Ly, and I started to create this unique enthusiasm, and I started to organize the issues of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peacebuilding platform of women, a movement of women, leaders of various different life, whose goal is to be public-based, to come up with the sociological empowerment of women and to be the right of the political and democracy.
In the study, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more powerful, a environment that was shaped by the selfish political politics and the act.
I was a initiative of peacebuilding campaign to reach women to a passive vote, a law that would have any citizen, no matter what the background should be, and to vote for a third-person, and to a political foundation between two-dimensional and vertical-level.
And we've been taken to our initiative and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's land in the first elections since 52 years.
But long, the euarchy of the election had given the whole revolution to "cause every day we're going to have new news on violence.
We were announcing the lead of ancient mosques and the Sufi brothers.
In another morning, we got the message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then, after another morning, the murder of the armed suicide was signed by the army.
And it's really true that we're at the tyris of the military and their ongoing, against human prisoners and their preferences of rules.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized, and moved from the ideals and principles, dignity, social justice that they were beginning to follow.
Beaction, intention and revenge became the icon of the <unk>the<unk> War<unk>s<unk>.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our preconcessional and the elections.
I'm already here today to suggest that we've met a nation that's wrong and wrong choices.
We've put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections had not brought peace or safety or safety in Ly.
Does the hard and the shift between female and male leaders and national reconciliation?
No, she doesn't.
What is it?
Why is it that our society will continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and the rest of men as women?
Maybe the women were not the only who missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gade and the union.
We need a national dialogue and expertise as it took to the elections that only has the polarization and mutilation.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female as they need the standard, negative, negative, gender-in-in-in-in-expression.
We have to stop doing the name of the anger and demand a day of the revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gade.
We have to develop a female discourse that is not only paying attention to the next values, but also, for example, Rice instead of working, instead of competition, instead of a lack of action.
These are the ideals that need a war to be able to get peace to peace.
Because peace has an alchemia and in this alchemie, it's about the seduction of the feminine and the masks of the world.
That's the true disbelief.
And we have to do that in a way before we do it, it's a sociological thing.
After a stop from the Koran, "Salam" -- "the God" is the word of the Good God, "sick."
The word "rave" is known in all the late 19thult traditions, the same root root as the word "The Poor" and "Fear" -- the female of the feminine of humanity, the whole man, the female and the female.
And just like the mother under the embryo that grows in his life, completely so much of the rest of compassion is the existence of existence.
And so, we said, "My God's favorite is all things."
And so I said, "My Gade" has been on my way."
For us, all the ruins of the Gade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought that my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Eothing."
And I was very proud.
In the school, we were looking at the story of Kim Il, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And I often wondered how the outside world is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all the time.
I saw myself at the first time, I was looking at a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer to any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a sister of mine.
And he said, "If you're here, our five family members will not be there anymore in the world because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're together in the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon.
I was so shocked.
I heard that for the first time, people who were suffering in my country.
And I went over the board, and I saw something horrible that I couldn't get away from my memory.
A black woman was on the ground, and a broken child in his arm was blindly blindly in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'0s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
In the end, more than a million North Koreans liked to sacrifice, and many more of them have survived because they ate grass and forest.
Luge has become more likely to keep it out at night, except the lights of China on the other side of the pyramid that we lived.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and North America.
This is the river of the orchestra, the one that is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, and allow Northstore to escape.
But many people die.
I sometimes saw bodies on the river.
I can't tell you how North Korea left, but I can say that when I was sent to the late years of famine to the distant relatives of China.
I just thought I was separated for a short time from my family.
I never thought it's been 14 years to have a life.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be like the Northstore of refugee. But I soon learned that it's not really very difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees have seen refugees in China as a foreign immigrant.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me into a terrible fate back to North Korea.
And one day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police and sent into the police department.
Somebody was harassed to be Northstore, so they tested my Chinese and gave me countless questions.
I was so afraid of this, and I thought my heart would explode.
If you're a little bit skeptical, you could be trapped and you're being trapped.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made it to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they've done the questions, a officer said to the other, "That was a false deal.
It's not Northstore.
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Now, some North Koreans, he's looking at China in foreign messages likeylyl, but a lot of the police are caught and shot.
These girls had great fortune.
And despite the time they've caught, they were finally released by tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much fortune.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans in China, and they're already released to North Korea where they're tortured or publicly executed.
And I was afraid of my happiness, it's not all the time that I was in the North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle to survive.
And after she's learned a new language and work, their world can be sent into a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I went to South Korea to be a bigger challenge than I thought I had.
English was so important in southern Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
I've also seen the big difference between the North and South Korea.
We're all in the middle of Korean, but we've been very, very close to this, but it's been based on 42 years.
I was walking through a identity crisis.
Am I a South or Northstore?
Where am I? Who am I?
And suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
And although my art is not easy for the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording of the university.
I was more likely to have been more likely to have my new life, and I got a shocking call.
The Northstore government started the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family forced to participate in a remote place on the country.
They had to be flying as fast as possible, so I started to plan their flight.
North Koreans have to have a tremendous route back to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between the North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself on the way to the North Pacific border.
Because my family didn't speak a Chinese, I had to run them up to more than 2,000 miles across China and then go to South Asia.
The bus drove a week, and we've been caught almost a few times.
Once the bus was on, a Chinese police police officer came in.
He took the point of all of them and started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they'd be arrested.
When the Chinese officer gave up my family, I decided to come up and say that she was a child, and I was a sermination.
He looked at me and he was laughing at me, but fortunately he believed me.
We managed to get it up to the iald border, but I had to have almost all my money to get the border of Lora's border.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was inappropriate, because of illegal border.
After I paid money and a bakery, my family was released within a month, but shortly, my family had been replicated in the capital of Lora.
This was one of the biggest traces of my life.
I've done everything to keep my family's freedom, and we've been close to that, but my family was just before the South Bronx's message.
I went and I went across the foreign authorities and the police department, and I tried to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay money back to cash or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is concerned.
In broken English and I explained to a dictionary, and I explained to myself and without a bank, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them to jail.
I thank him about the whole heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
Now, the previous stranger of the earlier designed a new hope for me that the North Koreans needed so much to be, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I've added to southern Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
Most North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they come into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, learning English, the professional education, many more.
We can also be able to change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with families, and we send them information and money that help North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to be able to lead my late North Koreans to success, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, but also on stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good.
He can't talk, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to give it unconditional, and he's going to give it back to it.
It's not a wug. He doesn't care about the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just tell you, he never told a lie.
When he sang songs from our childhood, he tries to be about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of a thing: How little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown has to be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has absolutely unconditionable memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he's stolen my chocolate fries, but he remembers the week of every song on my iPod, conversation that we had when he was four times the first episode of the Cublet on my arm, and his husband.
Don't listen to it?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they often have been understood and wrong.
But what made me more encouraging my heart and my soul, was that although it was the case that they were typically similar to them, it only meant that they were extraordinary -- with autism, and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't feel familiar with the term "compassionism" is a complex disorder of the brain that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a way of looking at each individual, and it's very different to a part of the way that you're a Sami.
And the world is going to have noticed every 20 minutes in a new language of autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing development factors in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time when I'm watching autism, but I can't remember it any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He's very much.
He didn't want to play like the other babies did, and he didn't seem really interested in me.
And Michaeli lived in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a row to get the washing machine and eat everything that was behind him.
And when he was older, he was different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the shorm, and the never end of hyperactivity was something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had ever seen.
It's not surprising.
Now, I can't deny that there was a few more challenging moments in my family, moments I wish that they were exactly what I was.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, about the communications, and love, and I understand that these things that I wouldn't want to compete against normality.
And it's a common thing about the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we're different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and Sam, it would be not normal.
You're going to be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have -- we have a gift of us! And everyone has a gift of us, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of the potential.
The chance for scale, progress and change dies in the moment where we try to be somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Edocon has been filled with awe and curiosity, with this photo on a project, with a apple, and with a weapon of radiation, only a halfth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography that the Ftoto Trace photography, a new engineering technology that is so fast that it can create time-time-time-time-time-like images.
And so we can build cameras that are looking at the distance of our view, or without a <unk>-ray in our body, and really ask what we're doing with the camera.
Now, if I take a laser clip and take it in a second-by-halfth-half-by-half-by-half-by-step -- this is a series of photons that are hardly long, and this satellite is going to move into the speed of light, and as a half-dimensional project, and as a normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photons, and you take it into this bottle, how are these photons going into the bottle?
What's the light that looks like in slow motion?
So, this whole event --
So, think about this event, it's actually going to take less than a nanototote -- so long, so the light takes you to go back, but I'll try to get this video to the 10 billion, so you can see the light in the movement.
No, Coca-Cola has not financed this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of stuff happens, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, the piece of our project, goes into the bottle with a photonsuit that begins to move through and eventually break into the inside.
A part of the light is going to turn off the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons are finally going to the end of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's headed around in the bottle.
And in the meanwhile, the waves are up on the table, and because of the reflection of the screen, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a typical project and let it go back and take the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, a week? No, a year.
It would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what does it look like with a silent experience?
You can see how this wave of the table, the Tom and the wall on the background.
It's like when you put a stone in a pond.
And it seemed like the nature of the world was going to paint this picture, one of the things that I saw, at a time, but of course, our eye looks a couple of frames.
But if you look at this Tom's, you'll notice that when the light is streaming over, the lights are going to keep it back. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is closed, and the light is going around, and after a few-by-half seconds,
So in the future, if this Fto-Mouse is built in your Cameroon, it's possible that you can go to a supermarket and find if an fruit is closed without touching it.
So how did my team at MIT have built this camera?
So, as a photographer, if you know, if you're doing a photo with a short-term radiation, you've got very little light, but we're going to have a billion times faster than your long-term radiation, so you'll get pretty much like the light.
So here's what we're doing. We're sending this project, this photons, a multi-a-half-half-half-hour, and then we're going to draw it back with very clever synchronization and combine this gigabytes of data, we're actually putting it together to create this FDTTTT, which I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do it very interesting.
So, Superman can fly.
And other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superheroes: Can the corners?
The idea is that we can turn something on the door.
It's going to be replicated in the space, a part of it will turn back to the door, and eventually, back to the camera, and we could use these more and more nuanced routes of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see the front of the left camera.
And the wall is hidden in the wall, and we'll let the light go off to the door.
So after our paper was published in the Great Public Public Center, it was made by Nature.com.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project and we're going to be going to put them on this wall and these photons are going to be all in every direction, and some of the photons will be able to get our hidden glass, and then the light will turn the light back, and then the wall will be a tiny bit of light, and then it's going to be going to be very interesting at the very light time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Fto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-effective, and it can look at the world in the speed.
And of course, because of that, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of distance is.
So, by making a laser light, we can record a raw picture that -- how do you see on the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images, and we try and combine them together, and we can analyze the different light, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We've got to do a little bit of doing this before we can put the lab into the practice, we could build cars that are going to avoid and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can look at dangerous survivors, by looking at the window, we can turn the light, or we can build the end of the wall, and we can see the light, and the glass of the glass, and the wall.
But because of the eternity and tissue, that's also very challenging, of course, is why this is really a call for scientists, now, to think about FFT's photography, because there's a new visual process that could actually solve the next generation of medical problems.
So, like Docon, even a scientist, a science has become a art, a very ultra-second photography, and I realized that all of these billions of data that we're using, we can't do a new version of the computer, and we can do that, and we can't just take a new piece of light, and we can't see that light, and that's not just a light.
But it's something weird about this.
If you look at the waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us are moving away.
The waves should move us to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're flying almost in the speed of light, and Einstein would like to have seen this picture incredibly amazing.
The order to happen in the world is going to appear in the camera, so by adding the relationship of space and time, we can correct this bias.
So, don't care whether it's about photography or the propose of a new visual representation for medicine or new exhibitions, since we've been able to open all the data on our website and hope that the co-in-in-in-in-in-arting and the design community is supposed to be the next, and we should start to start to switch over the scale.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet each neighbor on the street so many wisdom is not going to be passed. But we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like a little bit of a stick, a spod and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much money do you pay to my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without any other?
How can we share our memories on the window and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for existing homes so that our communities have shared our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is ripped from the giant euths that had been held for hundreds of years, drunk and shade shadows, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time you never have, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are the city, but it's also the city that most of us have left in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how I can make it, and I thought something that changed my life.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in now.
But I'm really hard to keep this view of time.
It's easy to lose your daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the house into a giant box, and I wrote with a link between the gaps: "I want to die," I want everyone to come and get a piece of chalk, about their public and his public.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day was completely filled with the wall, and they grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you, which were written by the people on the wall.
I'm going to die, I want to be under piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to stand up with the International Recield."
"I'm going to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I want to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die, I want to live with the grid."
"I'm going to die, I'll keep them in my arms again."
"I'm going to die, I want to be somebody's artwork."
"I'm going to die, I'm going to be myself."
It was disquanted to a meaningful place, and the hopes of the people, and the dreams of the people, I would bring me to laughter, and I was so embarrassed as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and in a new way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking about what's most important, while we grow and changing.
I've done this last year, and I've received hundreds of news people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so I've built my colleagues and I've been building a constructionbox in the world like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have, when we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices with more and more.
Two of the most valuable things we have, we're time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often exaggerating to talk about death or only thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that most of us are strengthed.
The idea of death makes us life.
We shared our common spaces, which is the best way that we and as a community is important, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories that people can't help us around us, to make better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved with a very special problem for everyone who's busy working with autism, that we're like a business maker.
No one knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing today.
And dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're excited about the most amazing ball and the propers as you'll see the same.
You can have a remarkable amount of knowledge and abilities, and perhaps a basic predictive that a genetic component could have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroyed this extraordinary ability, and that's what it does for me to know about the people who had been in the time of a ballet.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to have to live with the improbable symptom of the rare, the cisility, the spanchise and other things that cause that disease, and so that's why we need to find the objective ability to discover the disease before it's late.
We need to measure the progress of objective objective, and ultimately, the only way to know is to know if we have a sense of cure, if we have a objective measure that can answer this question.
Now, trouble is that there's no cognitive activity in Parkinson's disease and other control, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. And the best thing is that this 20-minute test is the neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies never done.
What if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a pre-cludry trip to the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have any expensive hospital.
It costs 300 percent to study the neurological field, by the way.
So I want to suggest to you, in a non-conventional way, that we're trying to achieve this, because we're all in a certain way, virtual, like my Janel Interplet.
So here's a video of the vibrating vocal lobes.
This is what happens in the normal condition, when someone has made a speech sound, we can look at how we're a bad ball, because we have to coordinate all of these voices, if we're going to make the sounds, and we've got all the genes for the CP.
And as ballet requires a lot of exercise.
Think about how long a child needs to be talking about it.
And by the way, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal nerve, and so the limbs are affected by Parkinson's voices.
On the lower run, you can see an example of the unconvenuous vocalization of the slime mold.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
It's true, weakness, ephemity.
The language is used to be even more and more blind and we're a case of a rhinocon.
Now, this impacts of the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones, and the antic analysis, combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, so we can now find exactly where someone is in a vot, and only because of the mind.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not both non-invasive. The test is the test of neurologists.
It's not too much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And they're exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly what they're doing. They're not done by experts.
So you can do it yourself.
They're very fast, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're a little cheap, you can also use it in a very large scale.
So this amazing goals we can do now.
We can reduce the mathist problem for patients.
You don't have to have any routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from the historical observation.
We can do cheap mass support for clinical trials, and we're going to have the first study of the entire population.
Now, we've got the opportunity to look for the disease first time before it's too late.
Now, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's face.
With Aphip and patient's first, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data to provide the gift of these goals.
We have a call of "bocal" that is available to the three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who can call you, without Parkinson's disease, can be cheaper to leave images for a few cents. I'll say that we've already lost six percent of our goal in eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of it, we're going to say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to have to tell you if this person has a disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database in which there's a lot of different circumstances, which is interesting. Those conditions are important, because we're going to try to figure out what the actual marker is for Parkinson's.
Now, on the time, your 86 percent accuracy is the most important?
It's much better.
My students Thisisis -- I have to put it up because he's done so amazing work -- now, it's now the computer phone system that allows us to do this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
That means that people can call the people with a cell phone and call people with Parkinson's, and they could send people to Parkinson's voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Great Little and gentlemen and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya, and I live on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows behind my father and behind the kitchen park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a small-scale, and that means that wildlife can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that killed at night, and I woke up in the morning, and I found it was horrible. It was our only bumble.
My tribe, the tribe of the mass, believes that we came together with our animals and the garden of the sky, so why is why our animals have so much.
I learned lions as a child.
Our warrior is protecting our tribe and our ancestors. They're also led to this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years is responsible for the cows of his father. So that's what it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions help the cows see better.
But I didn't go. I went on.
I had a second idea. I tried to look at a bird.
I wanted to think that the lions thought I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird look at and go back, and the next time you come, and they say, the thing doesn't really move, that's still there.
And they're going to take the time and kill our livestock.
I stopped the Stall. I walked with a pelp in the hand, and this time, the lions didn't stop.
Gris fear light that moves.
I had a idea.
I was working on my room for a young boy all day, and once I once took the new radio, I once put it apart, and the day, I made it almost almost almost to me, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a motor drive from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn your right or left or left. He's blinking.
And I gave a switch to turn the lights up and turn it up.
This is a little-and-half-half-foot-billed bag.
And then I built all of these together.
The solar column is releasing the battery that drives electricity to the right. I call it a transator.
And the correct box is bright.
You can see that the sabs are going out, because they come from there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are flashing and the lions believe I'm going to go to the skace. And I've been on bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our home, and since we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've been running seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good at the lights.
Now, I'm going to have this idea now in Kenya, for example, for other predators like hygiene or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from sea.
My invention sent me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brook School School School School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved, and it helps donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights there where there's no one, and I'll show the people how to use them.
I just went to a boy from the savanna who was eating my father's planes on my shoulder, and I looked at my way, and I said, "Eops, I'll sit in a!"
And I'm standing here.
I had to be a plane that I had for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot, that's my big dream.
I used to cover lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and lions, we can live together with a page with lions, without argument.
Ash Ol<unk><unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is, a story about listening to your eyes.
So you've got this scholarship now. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
So my next invention, now, I work on a electric fence. A electrode?
Well, I know that electrical pune has been invented long ago, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it all the time, right, right -- Yeah, I've tried to do this, but I've given the attempt back, because I got a catch.
It's very hard. Richard Turder, you're kind of special.
We're going to be free to you at each step of your house, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in your hand, and I want to share my passion, but today I'd share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of a masterist, no style, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting.
And to be honest, most of them were shot from a period of tourists.
I started a talk for a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture that I gave my daughter on my first birthday, and we were on the corner of 57 and 5th.
So a year later, we've been back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture once.
Well, you can see what's going on?
When the third birthday came closer to my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why do you not take Sabina to New York and do a father's first-granddad to get the ritual back?"
And at the time, we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture, when you're having a complete stranger on your camera.
No one ever said, and fortunately, never has ever been with a camera with us.
And at the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just a couple of weeks before 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a shock moment or a certain journey.
It's also for us to be a possibility for a week in October, to keep our time and how we change our time in year, not just physically but physically to reflect.
Because while we do the same picture, our perspective is changing time, while they're going to reach new windows, I can see the life with their eyes, how they do with everything and how they see it.
This is a very intense time that we spend with each other that we appreciate, and every year,
So, as we walked out of our travel, we were walking, and suddenly suddenly, they were looking like a red ball on a ball like a little kid who had learned to love with a little child before the earlier travel.
And she told me about their feelings that she had been at the same age of five years.
She said that she remembered her heart from the chest when she saw the first time he saw the store for nine years.
And now they look at them in New York for high schools because they really want to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not nearly a family photo.
I'm always the one that does this.
I want to encourage you to come up with this today and ask you not to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 22.13, 53.4/29.4/17.6/10.8 (BP=0.948, ration=0.950)
