When I was 11 years old, I was blown away one morning from the sounds of bright joy.
My father listened to his little, terrible radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was quite unusual at the time, because he was most traumatized by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban were pouring the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned girls to go to school.
And so for five years, I was embarrassed as a boy, and I was with my older sister who was no longer allowed to go alone to a secret school.
That's the only way we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so that no one could guess where to go.
We're sitting in a shopping bag, and we're just watching our books in a shopping bag, and we're just going to run.
We were doing this in a house, and over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of neat, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And every time, the class had to drop out of class for a week, because the Taliban had a reputation.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family where education was critical and female.
My grandfather was ahead of his time.
And one of the outsiders from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted that his daughter -- my mother -- was to school and was violated by his father.
My mother was a teacher, but she was a teacher.
Here she is.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in the neighborhood.
And my dad -- and here's the first one in his family, who ever got a school education.
For him, it was always clear that his children were going to get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much greater risk of not sending his children to school.
I remember that in the years I was so frustrated with the Taliban, sometimes, we were so frustrated by our lives, by the constant fear and the perspective of immatility.
I was so good to give up, but my dad said, "Tdaughter, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing will always remain you: what's in here. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my peers have higher degree than the high school degree, and if my family hadn't used so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I stand here today as a proudly Palestinian middlebury college.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he was complaining to send his daughters to school, one of the first was the congratulations that he was congratulating.
He's not just paying a degree of college, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the one who runs through the car in Kabul.
My family thinks of me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even more dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start an SOLA, the first and possibly an Internet service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to feel great, grand, ambition to all of them perceive potential chances.
And seeing their parents and fathers stand for them, and as my parents then, despite all odds, were against all odds.
And as Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed was one of my students' father.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and she was killed by a bomb on the side of the road for only a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone rings, and a voice would say to him if he was sent to school, she would try again.
And he said, "Well, if you want me, I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your old-talking and over-deviewed imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that's often permeated in the West: behind most of us who have success, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who is aware that their success is also success.
I don't mean that our mothers don't have a role in our success.
They're often the ones who are more likely to think and be more compelling about the prospective future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely essential.
The Taliban just went only a few hundred girls to school, because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls, the school bank does hit.
Afghanistan appears, from America, so different.
Americans realize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the length, and they're changing everything with the citizens' markets.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents, who are using them, who are encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unbridled possibility, and remember the girl every day, going to the SOLA.
Like me, they have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, however I'm living -- my life was shaped for seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on the engineering projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO project, and I failed every single project that we put on my legs.
I was desperate.
I mean, 21 years ago, I thought we were a brilliant bunch of good people, and we were making good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were looking at.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book in Burtles, the Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias how food was being formed.
We came up with Italian seed in southern South Sudan, in this blunt valley, which leads to Sami-Sord. We taught the local community of the crop in Italian tomato and Zuchini and ...
Of course, the local people had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
And we were amazed that there was no agricultural waste in this fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God you for being here!"
Voice 2: Just in time to rescue the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these magnificent tomato sauce. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the queens, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato tires and red were red, about 200 of them were flying around the river and doing everything.
We said to the Sambennas, "Oh my God, the nunkers!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us that? "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were in Italy so great brages in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the English countries did, and after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the uteress.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've given to our African.
You should read the book "Dead Aid," from Dambisa Moyo, she's a joint economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given a quarter-a-a-half trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what that money was doing.
Just read your book.
Consider a African woman, what we did.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we hypnotize them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words come from the Latin root fry, which means "fater" means "fater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm treating every other culture than they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bwana, head.
I got more excited when I read the book "Sy's Beautiful" of Shum. He said, especially in economics, when people don't want help, they'll leave you.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the floor, and he asked, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocolalated?"
When I was 28, I decided to respond only to people, and I created a system called the company that never was initiated, never was motivated, but you become the service of the local passion, the servant of the local man who has the dream to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you sit with the local people.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in kelelps.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to close with friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like it, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing to humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one trap: Why not to come in a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them? Not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Entrepreneurs never have a part of it, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what opportunities they see.
So, programming has this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working on one thing to do that, and we've got to do it in a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the residential hospital, the hospital of the company who sits in your house with you, at your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the resources, your passion in a way to transform the lives.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was a doctor who was now trying to escape the disengage, the crushing, where we say other people what to do.
And so I walked only through the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, my first clients, I helped him. He was a fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell to a restaurant in Perth, and he came to the fishermen, and they said, "You did it?" Can you help us?
I was helping these five fishers work together, and I was not going to sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents aKilo, but to Japan for sushi for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them. Can you help us?
In one year, I was walking 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I do something very, very hard.
I'm holding my mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- So the government says, "Let's try again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping over 40,000 companies in the founding world.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on in loneliness.
And then, Peter's printer, one of the best CEOs in history, died at 96 years ago.
And Peter Eno was a philosophy professor before he was working with companies, and Peter Engineer said that design is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics.
So planning is the death crat of the entrepreneur spirit.
So you build Christchurch, and you don't know what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to you.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to be enough.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What are you most applaudably applaud about this morning?
"Sake you, passionate people. You applaud that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- we have the neolocation of fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open-off of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, transport, transport, and share with them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Are we afraid.
Governments? Forget it.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to discuss the future of the city in New York in the 1860s.
In 1860 they came together and scanned what would happen in the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was, the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows at the same rate, they needed six million horses to kill the people, and it was impossible to get the crap done by six million horses.
Because they were already in the crap.
And 1860s, they see the dirty technology that makes life look like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automobile companies in the U.S. -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little small factories in the backlands.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to be offered discretionation.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, everyone has to be able to perform three things: to sell a product, it has to be grand, it has to be grand, it has to be grand, it has to be a huge governance.
What do you have?
We never met one person who could make something at the same time, sell and save money.
It doesn't exist like this.
This person was never born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been common in common, one: no one was founded only by one person.
We now teach 16 year-old graduates in Northland entrepreneurs, and we start teaching them to give two sides of Richard Bransons Imscreen. The task of 16-year-old is to enlist the first two sides of Richard Bransian Imscreen, how often he uses the word "h" and often.
Never "<unk> and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where a facilitator who has a small entrepreneur background in cafes and Bars. And their dedicated buddy, who's going to do what someone here in this gentleman talks about this epice, someone's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have got groups of volunteers who support corporate trust, helping them find the resources and people, and we found that the miracle of the local government's intelligence can change the culture and the economy of that community, only by detecting the passion, energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned what it should be like to be Alice in Wonderland.
The Penn State University asked me -- a faculty for communications -- to try to connect disaster engineers in communication.
I was scared.
I mean, that's true. Fear, before these students with their big brains and their large books and their large, I'm not trusting words.
But when the conversation evolved, it was like Alice, when she was standing down down to the eye for the guinea pig and saw a door to a whole new world.
And I also felt that when I was talking to the students, I was amazed at the idea that they had, and I wanted others to discover this miracle country.
And I think that to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need to really have great communications from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-scientist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please, please, please, please give us a hold.
So I want to show you a couple of the approaches that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're engaged with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, okay?
Let's tell you why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that their grazing is studying their grazing, but also tells us that their graves, their porky structure, are examining our bones, because it's important to understand and treat osteoposis.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to get pronounced.
Now, the language language is a barrier to the understanding of your mind.
Now, you'd all know, you'd use your "happy" and "have time-to-time," but why don't you just tell us "space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
And to make our mind understand is not the same as pushing off your level.
As Einstein said, "Take things just as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You may have told us something about your scientific area without having to deal with any tradeoffs.
So a few things are about this. Some examples, stories and analogies. They can draw you in your closet.
And if you present your work, let's go away the positions.
Have you ever asked why it's called "Stich"?
What happens when someone else is over here? One is taken once, and with those dots, your audience first.
And a slide like this is not boring, but it's also too boring to the subject to the subject of the brain, and that's how we're very quickly valued.
This is the result of Genevieve Brown. It's much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the whilch is so robust that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick is here to use an individual, just by drawing the word that the audience can lose, or re-express the thread, print pictures and graphs that also address our other senses, and thereby create a deeper understanding of what it is.
These are just a few approaches that help us open up those towers and see the wonderland that science and technology are coming in.
And because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to make a blank eye in me, I want to sum it all up with an equation.
Look at your science shows and your arguments, they divide it through the relevance, so the audience says what's important, and multiply the whole thing you've had for your incredible work, and it's a remarkable interaction. And it's extraordinary interaction that's full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you've solved this equation, I'm really hoping for you.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can do a drug with a cell phone, and you can actually film a crime in Syria in the world.
You can tweet a phone, and launch a report in Egypt.
And you can take a note with a cell phone, you can take it up, you can get it on the sound cloud and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year of 1994, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this town.
And you can see there, like hundreds of thousands of people on the road changing things, and showing up.
We are in the fall of 1989, and imagine that all these people who were coming out and asking change and got a phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, hold it up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot of them. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about myself and my cell phone, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Pumpworms.
And why are the information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission has set up a right line.
The right line is the benchmark for the reserve for the security.
The rule is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service provider in all of Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who's sending an email?
Who gets to send a text message to whom?
And when you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is saved for at least six months, up to two years from your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And all over Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want the supply of this protection.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone service and Internet service providers to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of them said, "We don't want to do that."
And here you can see, tens of thousands of people flocked around the streets of Berlin and said, "Funity instead of fear."
And some people even said this could become the stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the headscimpori in Eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is it really working?
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the pre-medated telecom, who was then the biggest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, I asked them, we'd send all the information that you've stored on me.
And I asked her once again, and she said, "I didn't get a right answer, just a clean Bla Bla."
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's tracking your protocol.
So I decided to take a court court court case, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And it ended with a comparison.
I borrow the rule back to which they were asking me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court court decided that the introduction of E.U. report was a complete violation in the German.
So I got this ugly brown, brown envelope with a CD.
And then the CD was this.
35.30 lines of information.
At first, I saw it and said to me, well, it's a huge file. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them publishing.
Because I want to show people what the supply of the law means.
So with time and open data town, this is what I did.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom out, and you can go back and forth.
You can track every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I'm going from Frankfurt to the train to the Pole, and how many calls I'm doing on the way.
And all of this is possible with this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, first of all, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're going to talk a couple of times.
And then some friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you, and we have this huge network of communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, what time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to whom you're talking to who you're sending an email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe, to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we would imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leader was, that would probably never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And again, not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today's national agency and companies want to store so many information about how they can get over us online and online.
They want the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all at a constant period.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, say your congressive, just because companies and state states have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it very long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to struggle for your own self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral office stores, rapid restaurants, Braille palms.
So the city planner meet and they thought to change the name of South Central America, so that it's for something else, it's changing it in South Los Angeles, as if that were changing something about what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
New-cost shops, rapid restaurants, bricks.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivethrus and the Drivebys.
The thing is, the Drivethrus kills more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles about curable diseases.
For example, obesity in my neighborhood is higher than five times, in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't really appreciate that.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, any time you go out of the house, you see the negative effects that the remaining food system on your neighborhood.
I made sure that wheelchairs was bought and sold as a means of transport.
I see dialogy-stouring centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what's going to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't really feel like a 45-minute donor to get an apple that's not mediated with pesticides.
So I planted a food fire in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a parking lot.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grus, together, and we started planting my food and fruit trees, the whole program, vegetables.
We're kind of a vime group, put in the bloodlines of all the social layers and all the city, and it's all voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else complained.
The city came up to me, and he was basically offering me a charge, and he said that I had to remove my garden, the front control was a riot, a confession.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
A rustle of food waste is a bar on a piece of land that doesn't care about you?
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand with it."
Because this time it wouldn't turn.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city Council, and I had a member of Green, and they submitted a petition to Change.org, and with 900 Signatures, we were successful.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My city council even called and said they were supporting it and loving what we were doing.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest plains in the city in the United States.
They have 4,200 kilometers of biling.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato cells.
Why the hell shouldn't you find it all right?
From growing a plant, you get 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, there's a dollar worth of food, and vegetables are under 75 dollars.
It's my name of mine, I say people to make their own food grow.
to grow its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I dare be part of this preconceptive reality that was made by other people, and I made my own thing.
You see, I'm an artist.
So gardenwork is my graffiti. I use my art.
Just as a graffiti artist, the walls are flashing, I swear my lawn and air plants.
I use the garden, the soil, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my niece for these cloths.
You'd be surprised to see what the ground floor can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the ground.
And you'd wonder how children might be influenced by this.
And gardeners are the most therapeutic and the most audacious act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You get strawberries.
And I remember this time, when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10 o'clock in the night. They were in my backyard, and I came out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a place with no reason in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry and hungry, and that only made me feel empowered to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum Devil, no, I'm not afraid that they're stealing.
And it's on the road.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
Another time, I put a garden in the bedroom's house in D.C.
These are the guys who helped me to get the truck out of the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how they planted them with their mother and their grandmother, and it was really amazing to see how it changed, even for a moment.
Green Grains have planted about 20 gardens.
And we had about 50 people in our wakeup containations, and they were all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get any of them, if they're not shown, how food and body affects them, they're blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids, they're just on the path that they're pointed out for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
And the gardening community, I think, is an opportunity where we can train these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make George Washington Carver the next one.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole garden block where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscontco and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking free-to-shit, because free is not sustainable.
The com comet of sustainability is you have to keep them through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and having them enjoy the joy of honor and honor when you build up your own food, and when you open up farmers.
So, what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gang, gangsta, gang gardeners.
We need to turn the picture of the lamps.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangke.
So, how do you have to do a more pop-up, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up in a game barry and want to sit in and make a meeting where you're talking about making some clothes.
If you want to meet me, come with your taps, in my backyard, so that we can plant some cush.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful,
And "It's" for "the poor politician.
Although in the 19th century, a new publisher took a better definition: "A Snollygasterdy is someone who plays a mandate, independent party, program or post office, and his success is achieved by the pure power of the monumental hypothetical bias."
I have no idea what the other way to do that.
I think something else.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
So 1771, for example, according to the U.K. parliament, newspapers were not allowed to ban the exact word of the debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with an extraordinary name called Brassby who had a parliament.
And she took it to the Tower of London and he loaded him, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to fight, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence, "so believe in the brass."
Brassical to the English word for a tin.
But that's not true. It's coming back to a secret supporney of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to America at the time when it just reached its independence.
And you're looking at the question of, what do you call George Washington, the head of state?
You didn't know.
What is the leader of an Iranian nation?
and there's been an infinite debate about this in Congress.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions to do this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Governor Washington, and others, his high-rurity George Washington, and others, defenses the freedom of the people of the United States of America.
Not that much like that.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was approved.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted the king for a certain amount of time.
It could work.
But everyone was bored in a little bit, because this debate had three weeks to get it.
I read the journal of a Senate that's always going on: "Take the same topic."
The reason for the delay, and the boredom was that the House was against the Senate.
The Kansas House's representative didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want him.
And the king would call it, and it might take it to ideas about its success.
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most dazzling title, the most dowiest title that they could think of.
This title was "Askesty."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before, but he just meant someone was carving a meeting.
It's something like the end of a jury.
He had no longer the size when the record "dated" or "diecture."
Sometimes there were the presidents of smaller colonial people and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
So the Senate refused for him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy must sign the agreement and meet foreign bribes.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, you didn't want to use the "diction" in your mind, but they absolutely wanted to understand that they were not agree for their unconceentioned, the common-scale, the institutions of the nations, whether it's in the United States, where it's in the state of the state of the official, not necessarily compelled, not compelled, and the president of the nations.
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One is -- and this is the best one -- and I've been able to figure out, well, I haven't seen whether the Senate ever had the name of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just called the title. He just wait for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government tells you that something is temporary -- wait 223 years later.
Third, and this is really important, this is the most important point, is that the frontline of the United States of America today sounds so humorous, right?
This is something that has to do with more than 5,000 nucleic swamps that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
The truth and story have given the title of size.
And that's how the Senate ended up winning.
You got a respectable title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the sounds of self-interest, well -- it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound the same way that the guy has with the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative hospital lost, because no one feels humbly when you're told you're now the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebellion in fighting jyalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would paint my black Conconcessive gloves against a pair of brown leatherymles and fire a rocket in the direction of the government regime I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been thinking about war a long time ago, but besides the time, Pyjama party and football game at Samst, and he fought with racist South states and interference demonstrations that never lived with communism for a long, and Afghanistan and Convention, before I knew what it meant.
But that's the geography of the self.
And so I'm standing here, I think, a more soft Afghans, South nations program by God Gnades, an atheist, and a radical political artist who's been working in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So, there are lots of great things in Afghanistan about the art, but I personally don't like to paint rainbots. I want to make art mixed up, and authority is reflected in and revision the reality and even using a kind of imaginative citizenology to try and understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- wade who is fighting jihad against communists like "Vop-bling" and used armed religious-to-whignation and political corruption to enrich itself.
And what else can jihad's best do than to run the parliament for the parliament and to have a choice campaign with the slogan: "Please choose me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi who are spending on national heroes.
I want to leave the corruption in Afghanistan with a project called "Rearing Ritation," where you're a cop, a false control position on the streets of Kabul and keep cars on cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, provide money, provide money, and in the name of Kabul, and hope for them to assume that they take 100 Afghans.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has grown in my mind for the Cropian conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that only can be capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bomber, where I was creating the fur from local Afghan dressers with a seed-to-control, or several tile bags in a very fashionable and a Western art.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan of Kabul looked from the Thiplingship of 1899 to create a dialogue about how today's development organizations have its origins in the past colonial rhetoric about "The White Leach of Man" to protect the brown man from themselves and maybe even to one-to-face a small civil.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of self does it require.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been working as a model.
It's been said 10 years ago, exactly.
I felt like I was building in this room right now a kind of unconditional tension because I shouldn't wear this dress.
I'm lucky enough that I've got a little bit to change with this.
This is the first time someone is raising on the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness, I think, to see that.
If some women were really shooking when I came out, you don't need me to say this later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm quite privileged because I can change what you think of me in very short, 10-second seconds.
And that's not the chance everybody has.
These rejections are very uncomfortable, it's good I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to laugh me out, so no, as long as it's above my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Now, it was not as embarrassing as this picture was, I hope.
And image is powerful, but image is also super-ficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I've never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should turn my back and put my hand on the hair of this guy.
And beyond surgery or the wrong ones I've been thinking about for the work two days ago, there's only a very few ways to change our utterance, and our utterance is that although it's superflate and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless is to be honest with me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a lovely white woman, and in my business, we call this an sexy girl.
So I'm going to answer the questions that people are always asking me, but in the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you model a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason, as I became a model, is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important heritage, and you might wonder what that legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have no longer defined beauty as healthy and primitive and symmetrical, in which it is a cosmology that we're programmed to be biological, but also as big, hard, feminine, bright, bright.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionist letters come up, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smel. Huh."
And first of all, I'm talking about your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has all been counted modules on the runway, each of which was being dated, and that in fact, 677 species were not only white for only 27 or four percent.
The next question that's always being asked me is, can I become a model when I grow up?
And I said first, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be anything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-famous surgeon, which would be completely misastrous, because you're the first one."
And when they say about this great countermission, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who the driver of my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head of American bird fame or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like saying that you want to win the Jackor in the Lotor.
You can't manipulate it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of a genetically constructed model of knowledge, because, unlike heart surgery, it can only be disintegrated right now.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice radiation, and the customer said, "Cameron, we want a picture in a run," now, the leg goes first, and long, and long, this arm, back in the back, is on the back, on the back, on the side is three-quarters, and you move right back, and you just look back, and you see, you see, you see, your friends
It looks something like this.
I hope that it's less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and you have a life cycle and a few jobs, you can't tell much more, and if you say you want to be president of the United States, but in your lifetime, "10 years of underwear," you'll be considered weird.
The next question that's been asked a lot is, "Who is going to revise all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are retured, but that's just a little bit of what's going on.
This is the first photo I did, and this was also the very first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my period back then.
I know this is going to be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
This is just a couple of months before my grandmother looked.
This is me the day of the launch.
My friend had to come and join me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a couple days before a bice song for French birdhood.
This is me with the football team and in V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you see that these images are not images of me.
They're construction, and they're a group of professionals, of Hairstylists and make-up artists and photographers and Stylists and all of their assistants and the F.F. reproduction. They're not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Do you have things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cent-seft gloves I can never wear, except just, but the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a shop and I forgot my money, and you gave me the dress for nothing.
So, as a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a horrible driver, and she was going over and she was going through a red light, and of course, it took all the time. It just gave me, "Excuse me, Mr. Wachts," and we could go on.
I got this free-litting stuff about my appearance, and I didn't have people who pay for their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 140 teenagers who have been stopped last year, and was filtered, and there were 85 percent black and Latinos and mostly young men.
They live only 177,000 young, male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Am I stopping?"
And she said, "How many times am I stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
And in my research, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is rising at 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question I've been asking is, "Well, what is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting that answer: "If you're a little bit thinner, and you have a shiny hair, then you feel really happy and fabulously."
And backstage, we give an answer that might give that sense.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half of the story, because we never say before the camera, which I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure, because every day I have to think about my appearance.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had thin legs and shiny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most spinny legs and the most gloomy hair and the most cool clamble, and they're the ones that look the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to move an honest balance, because on the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable to sit here and say, "I got all the benefits of a stack that was being bathed for my sanction." And it doesn't feel very good at saying, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was especially difficult to reconcile a heritage of oppression and race when I was one of the greatest beneficiaries of it.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've managed here before I've been there, 10 or 30 years since my career has gone, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I was getting my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I was paid, which is so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our strange successes and failures.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to the exile of life: "Son, leveled Gaddafi's resistance. Let's hear him.
But never, it's going to be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been nearly two years since the Libyan revolution has been inspired by the waves of mass-povering in both of the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I connected myself to many other Libyans, within and outside Libyens, to challenge the veil of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyranny regime of Gaffis.
And there she was, a great revolution.
Young, licensed women and men in the front row, demanded the end of the regime, held slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've demonstrated some cutting-up mutant by putting Gaddafis against the brutal dictator.
They showed a strong sense of solidarity, from far from far from the far west, all the way to the south.
After a period of six months of cruel war and nearly 50,000 deaths, we managed to free our country and to overcrow the tyranny.
But Gaddafi also left a huge burden, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption, and the foundation for the book shift.
Over four decades, Gaddafi's tyrant regime has broken both infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I refer to how many other women, to rebuild the civil society of lyas, and we demanded a public and a publicized transition to democracy and national equilibrium.
Near 200 organizations, and as soon as Gaddafis were founded in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started building workshops to organize the issues of capacity, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the Forest Syierian Association, a movement of women, leaders from various backgrounds, their goal, it's public for the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to be able to face our right-to-sense governance with democracy and peacebuilding.
In the case of the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and exclusion.
I was campaigning an initiative for the peacebuilding collection of women to reach a sovereign law, a law that would vote for every citizen, no matter what background to vote, and to run for a war, and most importantly, a male parties between a male and female in vertical and vertical plane, and to make a vigilade.
And we ended up being adopted and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the national bank worker in the first election for 52 years.
But long, but surely the euphoria of elections and the whole revolution, after all, we used to have new messages on the planet every day.
One morning, we woke up to the advancement of ancient mosques and Sufi sons.
Another morning, we got the message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
After another morning, the wounded were reported by the army.
And indeed, every day, we are at the tyrants of the licenses and their ongoing fortunes against human warriors and their defenses of laws and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mental state, polarized, and distant from the ideals and principles -- freedom, dignity, social justice that they were at the beginning.
Intent, rejection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our discourse and our elections.
In fact, I'm here today to admit that we, as a nation, have made false choices and made false decisions.
We've been wrong with our priorities.
Because elections did not bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the hard-line and changing women and male candidates have forced peace and national reconciliation?
No, it didn't.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to be polarized, and dominating selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, both men and women?
Perhaps women were not the only thing that was missed, but the female values of compassion, the gade and the complement.
Our society needs a national dialogue and convergence when it's needed the elections, which in the end, only has strengthen the polarization and disinplusion.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female, more than she needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop doing the laws of anger and demanding a day of revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gemade.
We need to develop a female discourse that will not only lead the values, but also to argue: evil instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, not an intentional.
These are the ideals that need a war ravaged lybia desperately to reach peace.
Because peace has an alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the interconnection of feminine and maskal view.
That's the real punching.
And we have to do that in an integral way before we do sociopolitical.
From an aftermath of the Koran, peace -- "is the word of the Good God, ravable."
The word "raitor" again, which is known in all the late-dath traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rahem" -- "to mother, symbolizes the female feminine, the whole humanity, of the manhood and the female, of all the peoples and all the peoples.
And just like the mother's junior growing in his life, it's completely surrounded by the basic posture of compassion that's ever there.
And so we were told, "My God's going to put all things together."
And so we were told, "My God's name has pre-songed before my penny."
And each of us will be the kind of a wade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with a song, "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were looking at the history of Kim Ilung, but we didn't really learn much about the world out there, except America, South Korea and Japan are enemies.
And although I often wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until all of my life was changing.
At the age of seven, I saw a public refinement, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter to a sister's sister of a colleague.
And she said, "If you were listening to this, our five-legged family members will not be in the world anymore, because we've had nothing to eat since two weeks.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people in my country laughed.
And I would end up in the car station for a while, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete anymore from my memory.
A black woman lays on the floor, and a pentged kid in her arm smelled helpless in the face of his mother.
But no one helped them because they were all busy taking care of themselves and their families.
The mid-1990s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were enjoying the victims, and many others survived just because they ate grass, beetles and forestgline.
And the rate of electricity has been increasingly and more common, so that at night, everything was darken about me, except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag that we were living on.
I was always wondering why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of ampr, which is part of North Korea as a border between China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vested and enabled North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can tell that, during the late years, I was sent to the dismantles of famine to China.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take us 14 years to work together.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a North Korean refugee, but soon I learned that it wasn't only very difficult, it was also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
And one day, my biggest nightmare was recognized when I was caught up in the police department and was sent to the police station.
And someone was accused of being Northern Korean, so they were testing my Chinese names and asking me a lot of questions.
I was so afraid of this, I thought my heart would explode.
And there's some unnatural coming in, and I could be locked and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
And after they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "That was a misguided conclusion.
She's not a Northorean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China were investigating asyl's foreign messages, but many of them are caught and rejected by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released because of tremendous international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, there are tons of North Koreans in China, and they're reported to North Korea, where they're tortured, imprisoned or executed publicly.
Even though I was lucky enough to be, many other North Koreans don't do it.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
and after learning a new language and finding work, their world can be turned upside down in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was a big challenge in Southern Korea, when I thought I was a big challenge.
English was so important in South Korea, and I had to start my third language.
I also saw the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of it, we're very diverged by a period of time, because of 67 years of the division.
I went through a heart crisis.
Am I South or Northstorean's grandist?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't fall easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording test at the university.
And just as I got to my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started the money that I was sending my family, and as punishment, my family forced to relocated to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go through an incredible route to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a trip back to China and made me on the road to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run it, over 2,000 miles across China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got nearly several times caught.
Once, when the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the case of everybody, and he started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I was determined, and told him that they were greeting, and I was her boss.
He looked at me very suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get to the Portuguese border, but I had to almost take all my money and put the boundary with Laos to the right.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was imprisoned, because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid my money and a hate-in-law, my family was released within a month, but only after that, my family was reunited, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest disregulations of my life.
I'd done everything I could to defend my family for freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Korean embassy.
I went back and went between the immigrant and the police department, trying desperately to remove my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back or pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was pretty surprised that a stranger was taking care of it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without complaining, he went to a benchrant, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him with all the heart, and I said, "Why help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to help the North Korean people."
And I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The former stranger in my mind, symbolized a new hope that required North Koreans so desperately, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I, again, united in southern Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, the learning, the professional education, and many others.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family support, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make hopeful North Koreans success with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, even on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
He's giving it meaningless, and he's dividing it.
It's not greedy. He's not fear color.
He's not taking care of religious differences, and just imagine: he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, when he writes out words, who I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has absolutely unconditional memory.
But he's also a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate fries, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while the first result of the teapleties on my arm was to put on my arm and Lady Gagas Day.
Don't listen to it, don't listen?
but a lot of people don't vote.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they're often over-reviewed and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul, empowered, was that although that was the case, even though they were not considered normal, it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- it was autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "authorism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that's influenced by social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's different than an individual, and that's why Remi is so different from Sam.
And the world's been finding in every 20 minutes of a new person with autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing diseases in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been talking about autism, but I can't remember it any day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He was screaming a lot.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and set his own world in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy on the tiniest things, like cars in a row in space, to fit the washing machine and eat everything that was behind him.
And when it was older, it became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the deficiency and the never-ending hyperactivity was something unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any bias, a human who had never been laughed.
That's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going back to thinking about the things they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I would not want to trade on normality.
Normal-gracidence is the beauty of the differences give us, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not supposed to be normal.
You can be remarkably.
Because, with autism or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody has a gift. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress, and change dies in the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been enjoying us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph on a project of a apple and a unit of radiation only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world as a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new imaging technology, so fast that it can create slow-time-sound images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look out at the outside of our area, or see an <unk>-rays in our body, and really ask what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it off in a billionth of a second, and I turn it off -- these are a couple of seconds of fissions -- I'll create a stack of photons that's barely a millimeter wide, and this photon dish, this project, will move at the speed of light, and as I said, a million times faster than a normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photons pack and shoot it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break in that bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event.
So, think about this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanosecond -- so long, the light to push back this route -- but I'd need to slow this video by the factor of 10 billion billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, ishes in the bottle with a photon dish, starting to move through it, and that eventually breaks in.
And part of the light comes out on the table, and you see the kind of variation in the waves.
Most of the photons eventually reach the cycle of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in the bottle that's ringing.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back the same route, and we can take the video back and slow it down to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
One day, one week? No, one year.
That would be a very boring movie -- -- a slow, normal projectile in motion.
What about a little still-life photographer?
You can see again, the waves of the table, the Tom's, and flatten the wall in the back.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It seemed like nature was painting this picture, and then, for one, a Femto image, but of course our eye looks a little bit of a puzzle.
But if you look at these Tom's, you'll find that if the lights are over, the lights are flashing, it's going to keep you dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom's mature, and the light in it jumps around, and it's coming back after a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if an fruit is mature without touching it at all.
So how did my team at MIT building this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of a short-lurial period, you have very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than the shortest air age, so you're not getting any light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this projectile, this photons pack, and we're drawing this over and over again with very clever synchrony, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make this fum video that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make things invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superstar: can it be seen in a way?
And the idea is that we're going to light on the door.
It's going to be crushing into the room, and some of it will bounce back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use this more torrent of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left-hand side, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden in a soup, and we're going to shut the light off of the door.
So after our paper was published in theNature Communications Center, it was extracted from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to rip this light project and we're going to put it on this wall, and we're going to put that photons pack in all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup, that will then break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the light and a tiny fraction of the photons back to the camera, but it will all be very interesting in time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-solving, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, by doing that, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point of distance is.
By illuminating a laser, we can take a raw image, which, like the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images, and we put them together and try to analyze the different light tubes, we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is the reconstruction.
We've got to do a little bit before we can actually put the lab into the practice, we could build cars that avoid collisions and detect what's behind the curve, or we can look for rare stakes of survivors, by looking at light, by reflected through the open windows, or we can build finalos that can see in the body deep, looking around the Ok-box and even the bars.
But of course, because of the blood and tissue, that's very challenging, and that's why this is really a wake-up call for scientists, is thinking about Femto photographer, because a new imaging tool could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as in Docerton, even a scientist, the science has become an art, an art of the ultra-fifth-fifth-century photography, and I realized that all this gigabytes of data we're collecting every time, not just a scientific image. We can also create a new form of a computer photographer with a time, and with paint, and we can't even look at all of those waves and go back to us.
But it's happening here, too, a funny thing.
And if you look at these waves under the bottleneck, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost recording light speed, we're all in the speed of light, we're having weird effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly.
So, the sequence of what's happening in the world will appear in a very repetitive sequence, so by applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So whether it's photography around corners, or whether it's creating a new imaging framework for medicine or new reference, since our invention, we've made all the data open and hope in our website, that the "compensators are the creative and the research community that we should allow us to stop the megacities, to turn us to the corner, to the next-to-second, to start with the questions.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with our people.
We don't make every neighbor in the street so many of the arguments are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and scamphids and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without worrying with each other?
How can we actually divide our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the long-lasting houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is choked by the huge bleed, which for hundreds of years have been loved, drunk and trauma, and shade, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever saw, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most abandoned property in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I could confuse it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me, and her death suddenly came, and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it gave me a clarity about the things that mattered to me in life.
But it's hard for me to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose and forget what's really important in your everyday life.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard and I wrote a shredded in the gaps: "Only I die, I want to -- everyone who came across, can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public.
I wasn't sure what I was expecting to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely crowded, and it grew and it was growing.
I want to share some sentences with you, written by the people on the wall.
"I wish I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I wish I die, I want to stand a full-sized over the International Crisis line."
"I wish I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I wish I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I wish I'd die," I want to live subconscious."
"I wish I die, I want to keep them once in my arms."
"I wish I'd die. I want to be a different cavalry."
"I wish I die, I want to be myself."
It was neglected in a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of the people made me laugh, to tears, to tears, and to fuse me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and obvious way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and remembering what's most important, while growing and changing.
I did this last year and got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction box and now became a new set in countries like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have when we have the opportunity to speak up and share our voices with others.
And two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often denied talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that makes us most powerful.
The idea of death makes us feel.
Our common places best show us what is important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities, our hopes, our fears and stories, the people around us can not only help us to create better places, they can help us to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm involved in effective mathematics. I think it's a very special problem for anyone who's been involved in disgusted mathematics, that we're like business consulters.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so today I'm going to try to explain what I do.
So dancing is one of the most human activity.
We are thrilled with the sight of the masterry ballet and trawlers, as you'll see in a moment.
For a ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and it might be a fundamental reposition that a genetic component might have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability, and that's what it does for me with my congressive Janppra, who was a ballet's still persistent at the time.
Over the years, we've been making a lot of progress in the treatment.
But still, there are 6.3 million people around the world who are suffering from this illness, and they have to live with the indeteity of weakness, tremor, and cifility, and other things that cause that disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We have to measure the progress objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether or not there's a cure when we have an objective metric that can answer that question.
And trouble is that there's no cognitive activity, and other ways of measuring the brain, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing that there is, the 15 minutes test, the neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it's never done. It's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would make a worthy tour of cleaning the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have to be a teensuit.
It's actually 300 percent of its time in the neurological unit.
And so I want to propose to you an unconventional approach that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a certain sense, virtual impenos like my confession of Janfri.
This is a video of the vibrating vocal tangles.
That happens in the normal state when someone was creating a speech gun, we can look at the coherent ballet dancer because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs when we're creating the sounds, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And like ballet, it takes a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child it takes to learn to speak.
And by the way, we can determine the position of vibrating vocal sounds, and just like the limbs are also the mood organs affected by Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom record, you can see an example of the irregular vocal evidence of the DNA.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Bad, weakness, gay.
The language is sometimes too lovers and shiny, and that's an example of the character.
So this impacts on the voice may be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision analysis, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now find where someone's in a spon of disease and health, just because of the vocaloid.
Now, how can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test was diagnosed with neurologists.
They're not good. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build a new clinics for this.
And both of them are exactly right. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very quick, but it's actually going to take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If it's extremely cheap, you can use it in a very high scale.
And this is the amazing goals that we can do now.
We can reduce logistic difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from shared observation.
We can do low-cost mass support for clinical trials, and we're going to do it for the first time, and we can actually do it in a very accurately, very accurately, very potentially, very quickly, very quickly, very quickly, very often, very best, very best, very often, very best, very best, very best, very best, very well, very well, very often, very best, very well, very general population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're taking the first step in this direction, we're going to start Parkinson's-s-noitial.
With Aculab and patient bike, we want to take a very high number of voices across the world to have enough initial data to do the best for the outcomes.
We have a voice number that's accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's, can call for a low-cost call to leave a few cents, and I'll be known to say that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, say, do we take 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is, the patient's going to have to tell you that the patient's in the phone call, whether this person has Parkinson's disease or not, OK.
Some of them may not get to the end.
But what we do is we collect a huge database, in many different circumstances, which is interesting. The conditions are important, because we're wired to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy is accurate.
It's much better.
My students, Thanasis -- I have to blame him because he's done such amazing work -- has shown that it's also worked on the cellular network, which is enabling this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a improvement.
That is, people can call, and people can call the phone and they can do the test. People could call with Parkinson's, they can let the phone, they can take their voice, so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
This is me living. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see my father's cows, and behind that is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the South, but it means that wildlife can leave the park any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. And I woke up in the morning, and she found herself dead. It was horrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the Native African tribe, believe that we came together with our animals and the heavens's treasures, and that's why our animals mean so much.
Even as a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our graves. They're also responsible for this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years old is responsible for his father. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Terror is fearing fire.
But then I realized that it wouldn't really help us, but it would help the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on going.
I had a second idea. I tried a bird's.
I wanted the lions to think I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the bird, they go back, and they come back. And the next time, they come, and they say, this thing doesn't move, it's still here.
and they reach and kill our livestock.
One night, I was listening to the stall. I was walking in the hand with a torch around him, and this time the lions didn't catch.
And the lion fear of light that's moving.
I had an idea.
I was working in my bedroom as a little boy, and I once took the new radio of my mother, and the day it almost took me around. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a power-panger from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn or left. It blinks.
And I made a switch to turn the lights on and off.
This is a little pam lamp out of a broken flashlight.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel invites the battery, the battery supplys the electricity to the correct power. I call it a transformer.
And the control response is flashing.
And you can see that the sins show outwards, because they come from there, lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights fluff and the lions believe I'm walking around the stairs. I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our home, and since then, we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good at work.
Now, my idea is now used in Kenya, also for other predators like hyenots and leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and help fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights in there, where there's no one there, and I'm showing the people how to use it.
A year ago, I was just a boy from the savanna who was chewing his cows, and I looked at planes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of them!"
And this is where I stand.
I was allowed to train an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to play. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and the lions. We can share a site together, side with lions, without any dispute.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electric inventions.
What's the next one?
So, my next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An electroconce fence?
Now, I know that electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, right -- Yeah, I tried this, I tried this, but I was left again because I got a shot.
The beginning is heavy. Richard Turer, you're something special.
We're going to hire you every step of your walk, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography, but today I want to share with you my 15 favorite pictures; and I didn't just do one of them.
There was no kind of executive, no style, no chance of taking a picture, not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by accidentally of araged tour.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife took this picture, where I held my daughter on my first birthday, and we were at the corner of 57 and 5th birthday.
Just a year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going from.
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and make a father's-daughter's Day to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking for tourists to take a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a complete stranger, your camera is enough.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one has ever said anything else with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travels would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just a week that was taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a puncture moment, or a specific journey.
They're also a way for us to go in October, to stop time and change the time we're going to be year and how we're going to year to year, not just physically, but in fact, to reflect.
And while we always do the same image, our perspective changes as time as time they're reaching new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and what it sees.
This very intense time that we spend on one another is something that we value and expect every year.
In the short days of travel, we went for a walk, and suddenly we'd keep it, and suddenly it's been turned out, and it shows a red tracker on a dolls, which they had learned as a little kid, at the previous age of travel.
And she told me about her feelings, her age five years, that she thought was right at that point.
She said she remembered her heart, her heart clambling out of the chest when she first saw the store the first nine years ago.
And now they look in New York, they look for high school schools, because they're trying to study it in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we're all creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in conscious memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides these 15 images, I'm hardly a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image and not ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
