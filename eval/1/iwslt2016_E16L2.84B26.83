When I was 11, I was a night-fuck-up-the-cap-cap-cap-capling kid.
My father heard his little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was rather unusual at the time, because he was most likely to get the news to be depressed.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban filed the power in Afghanistan when I was six years old, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so for five years I was incarcerated as a boy, and I joined my older sister who no longer would ever be allowed to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could go to school.
And every day, we took another way, so nobody could guess where we were going.
We were sitting in shopping bags to watch our books as if we were just going to run.
We were put in a house where we were over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was disgusting, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
After all, the class had to be out of the class for a week because the Taliban had swallowed gum.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family in education that was important and valued for daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
On an outside foreign aid from a remote province of Afghanistan, and it was about to send my daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was distracted by his father.
My mother was a teacher, but he became a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- you see here -- the first one in his family ever received a school.
It was always clear that his children were going to get an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much bigger risk of sending his kids to school.
I still know that in the years I was so frustrated by the Taliban, sometimes so frustrated by our lives, by the perpetual fear and the perspectiveless.
I was so glad to give up, but my father said, "Ton-daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be distributed out of your house in war.
But one thing you're going to always stay, is that what's in here. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have higher degree than the Sek-Dary degree, and if my family hadn't been using so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I stand here today as a proud exurin of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was distracted by his family because he proved to send his daughters to school, one of the first congratulations that he was congratulating.
He's not just paying me to graduate school, but also to the first woman and I'm the one who runs through the car in Kabul.
My family thinks about me.
I have big dreams, but my family has bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start an SOLA, the first and possibly a single intern for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school school school girls are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to look at the most mysterious opportunities that they ever want.
And seeing their parents and fathers stand for them, including my parents at the time, despite all the persecution.
As Ahmed. It's not really his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and she's gone through a bomb on the side of the road for only few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rings, and a voice threatened to beat him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
And he said, "Take me now, if you like, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter's Day because of your old-great-fashioned and overrecapted imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that's often passed out in the West: the majority of us who have success is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who knows that their success is also success.
I don't mean that our mothers don't want to play a role in our success.
They're often the ones that are common to be clear and compelling for a given future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely essential.
The Taliban just went to school a few hundred girls, because it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls in Afghanistan, they press the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be looking like America, so different.
Americans recognize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not for longer and with the decline of the U.S. population change everything.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unlimited possibility, and remember the girl coming every day, the SOLA.
Just like me, they have big dreams.
Thank you very much.
And all I do, even as I did -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
1971 to 1977 -- I see young, I see it not -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to projects with the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and I failed every single project that we put on the legs.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years ago, that we're a good young person in Italy, and we're doing good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were starting to do.
Our first project, which inspired my first book at the Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias how to grow food.
We got to the Sambesi River, Italian elephant in South Africa, and we got to the corner of the mountain, and we taught the local community to grow Italian tomato and to Zmini.
Of course, the local people had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they found them.
And we were amazed that there was no such a fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here!"
Voice 2: Just in time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had these magnificent tomatos. In Italy, they got so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Sambese said, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato got bust and red, about 200 pots were coming out of the river and they were freezing.
We said to the Sambenns, "Oh my God, the emerom!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were so excited in Italy, and then I saw what the Americans did, what the English world did, and then I saw what they did, and then I found what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We at least fed the kidney.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've not given to the existing African people.
They should read the book "Dead Aid," from Dambisa Moyo, she's a group of Indian scientists.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read your book.
Take a story of a African, imagine what we did.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we patron them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm treating every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bwana, headmaster, CEO.
I was greeted when I read the book "Syall," which is Beautiful," and he said, especially in the economic development, when people don't want help, they leave you alone.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the floor, and he said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocololal?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just respond to people, and I created a system called the company, where never started to be reintured, never be motivated, but you become the local talent, the servant of local talent, the servant, the dream of becoming a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you sit down with the local people.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in Kneip.
We have no infrastructure.
We close friend traditions and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
Now, if that person doesn't like it, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one case, why not to get in a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Never have entrepreneurs participate, and they'll never say publicly what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Let's have a look at this blind spot.
The best people in the community don't know because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working on one thing to do that, we need to make a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the Grand School Medical School Medical School Medical School, who sits in your house with you in your kitchen table and the cafe, helps you find the means to transform your passion in a way to live.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I trained at the time, and I tried to escape the disengage we have, where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking only through the streets in the first three days, and I was helping my first clients. I helped him find fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then he came to the fisherman, and they said, "You brought Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers, and I worked together, and I didn't sell this beautiful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents of K<unk>Kilo, but I went to Japan for 15 dollars of sushi, and then the farmers came up to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
So one year, I had done 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How are you doing this?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very, very hard.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- So the government says, "Let's try it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the founding world.
There's a new generation of companies that go on to loneliness.
And Peter printer, one of the best CEO of history, died by 96 years ago.
And Peter's Professor, who was working on business before he was working with, and Peter said, you know, design is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics.
So programming is the death carn of the entrepreneur spirit.
So you build Christchurch, not knowing what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get them to get you to one.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get out of it.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What's the best cheeky talk you guys want to do this morning?
"Searful, passionate people." You applaud this one.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- namible fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn machine is not sustainable.
The free-style unification is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, create, transport, and share with them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
Government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they were speculated, and what would happen in the city in New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows at this rate, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get rid of the dung for six million horses.
Because they were already out in the dung.
1860 they see the dirty technology that sucks the life of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little tiny factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing you need to do is to be offered to them some floppers.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, everybody needs to do three things: to sell product must be grand, the market market market has to be grandios and the financial governance needs to be huge.
What do you guess?
We never met one person who can make something, and then can sell and care for that money.
That's not true.
This person never was born.
We did research and looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been so popular, one thing that no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 year-old students in North Britain, and we start teaching them the first two sides of Richard Bransonsop Autograph, and the task of the 16-year-old is to help the first two sides of Richard Bransonsian Autographics, how often he uses the word "h" and often the word "we."
Never "I," and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where a facilitator who has a small entrepreneur in the cafeteria, and Bars. They're working with their dedicated buddy who's going to do what someone has done for this gentleman who talks about this Sposi, and someone tells you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you believe I find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have teams of volunteers who are supporting organizations to help them find the means of the means and people. We've found that the wonders of the local society are going to change the culture and the economy of this community can only capture the passion, energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should have been to be Alice in the miraculous country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to try to connect online engineers in communication.
I was scared.
I mean, really fear. I mean, I mean, these students with their big brains and their large books and their big ones, I'm not trusting words.
But as the conversation evolved, it took me look like Alice, when she was driving down to the eye for the might bomber and saw a door on a completely new world.
I felt the same way that I was doing conversations with the students. I was amazed by the idea that they had and wanted other of these miraculous lands.
I think that to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that we face our biggest problems, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and we don't understand it, then it's not going to go. I think it's in our responsibility as not a non-scientist, to be looking for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, let's go for a ride.
So I want to show you a few ways that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, okay, what?
Let's tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
It's not just telling us that their grandchildren are studying their grazing, it's also telling us that their grazing, the very plastic structure in our bones, are examining in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat osteosis.
And if you describe this what you do, then you will get rid of non-verbal.
Now, the rules are a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use your "go-lit" and "time," but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more obvious for us?
To make your mind understand is not the same as throwing down your level.
As Einstein said, "Take things just as simple as possible -- not simpler."
You can tell us something about your scientific area without having to work with any compromise.
So here are some things that are indicating, examples of stories and analogies, and that's how you can pull us into your hann.
And if you present your work, let's get the hits away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "the point?"
What happens when someone else is being bitten? Another one is going to be cut, and with those dots, you know, your audience.
So a slide like this is not just boring, it's also too much on the comments of the brain, and that's why we're very quickly advancing.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more effective. It shows that the specific structure of the limb is so robust that it actually was the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffviem Tower.
The trick is to use one individual, just by drawing sentences where the audience can lose the thread, or reuse images and graphs that also address our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that help us open up these towers and see the wonderland that science and technology are coming in.
because the engineers I've taught are taught to make the Noerdard in me in a tight way, I want to sum everything with an equation.
Look at your science, your numbers and your dictionary, they divide through the fine, so the audience tells you what's important and multiplying the whole thing you have for your incredible work, and it's going to make incredible, and it's going to make incredible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you've solved this equation, I'm very keen on it.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can actually film a drug with a cell phone, a crime in the human race.
You can tweet a phone, you can tweet a message, and start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a video phone and you can record a song, you can get it on the sound cloud and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year of Venice, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this town.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going on and showing things on the street.
We are in the fall of 1989, and imagine that all these people who were coming out and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how life has changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Coal data.
And why is this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. mission has launched a rule.
This is a policy line called the Department for Belefocks.
The rule is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service provider in all of Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who is going to send an email?
Who gets to send a text?
And when you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And everywhere in Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want it."
They said we don't want to get this legal supply.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet service to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, they all said, "We don't want it."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people flocked into the streets of Berlin and saying, "Freever is not fear."
And some people even said this could be on the Steasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the head-bimpicei in Eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is it really working?
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Degraph, who was the biggest telephone company in Germany then, and I asked them, I ask them, send all the information you've stored on me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I got no right answer. It was just a light blue.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that it's doing with its protocol.
So I decided to put a paper on it because I wanted to get this information.
But the German Telegraph said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And it ended up being compared to them.
I'm going to pull back the bill, and I'm going to send them all to the information that they were trying to do.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court determined that the introduction of the E.U. line was a law enforcement response.
So I got this ugly brown brown envelope with a CD.
And the CD was this.
35830 lines of information.
I first saw it, and I said to myself, well, it's a giant file. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a bit skeptical, what do I do with it?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make it published.
Because I want to show people what's called the U.S. Security Council.
So over time, with time, online data and open data City, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, track it.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt with the train to C<unk>nn, and how many calls I walk along.
And all of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I call my wife up, and she calls me, and we're going to talk a few times.
And then some friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call them up, and you call them, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, what times they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything you can see.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who's talking to whom someone is talking to whom someone who's email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we'd imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, had had had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would know who was doing this, and when the Stasi knew who the leader was, that maybe it would never happen.
The Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And then, again, the fall of the iron curtain.
Because today, the state agency and companies want to store so many information as they can get over us, online and online.
They want the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all for a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, you say your MPs, just because companies and state countries have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral stores, rapid restaurants, Brakill.
So the city map is coming together, and it was trying to change the name of South Central, so that it's for something else, it's changed in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
New Zealand restaurants, rapid restaurants, Braille palms.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivethrus and the Drivebys.
The comic thing is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles from a curable psychiatric disorder.
So obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't see that anymore.
And I was wondering how you would feel if you didn't have access to food, if you're going out of the house, you're going to see the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I made sure that wheelchairs buy and sell as a means of transport.
I see cartoons of comic Tound up like Starbucks.
And I realized that that's what we need to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And then I didn't really like a pair of minutes to get an apple that's not mediated with pesticides.
So I started planting a food hotwall in my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park park.
It's 45 feet tall.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I got here and my group, the L.A. Green Grass, and we, together, started planting my food heat, fruit trees, all that program, vegetables.
We're kind of a pre-medential group, put together by the gardeners of all the social layers and from all over the city, and it's completely voluntary and everything we do, it's free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he introduced me basically a resolution, and he said that I needed to remove my garden, the jet charge to a connotable configuration.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A popular account for growing food is on a piece of land that you don't care about?"
And I thought, "Cool. She's with it."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city Council, and with a member of Green, and they submitted a petition on Change.org, and with 900 Signatures, we succeeded.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My town minister even called and said that they support and love what we do.
So, really, why don't they do it?
L.A. has the largest temple in the United States in the country.
They have 4,600 miles of hardware rooms.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato cells.
Why the hell shouldn't you find it okay?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, the value of a dollar is given to fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
My name is my bears, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To grow its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of this preconceive reality that was made by other people, and I made my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
So my art is graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's punching the walls, I'm coloring lawns and air plants.
I use the garden, the soil, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my own in this stuff.
You might be surprised what the ground is capable of doing anything if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my backyard become an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You might wonder how children are affected by this.
And the garden is the most therapeutic and the most audacious act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can get strawberries.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10 p.m. at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out, and she looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not reasoned in the street."
I was ashamed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that just empowered me to do that. People would ask me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Zum Devil, no, I'm not afraid that they're stealing.
And it's the street.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
Another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in Downtown.A.
These are the guys who helped me to get the truck to the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it affected them, and how it had grown them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it has changed, maybe just for a moment.
Green Grasses have planted about 20 gardens.
We got 50 people in our wakeup stations, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow Kohl, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
If they don't get any of them if they're not shown, how food and body affects them, they eat blindly whatever you're sending them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids that are just like the path they're looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
And the gardeners, I see an opportunity, where we can train these kids to care for their communities to live a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole residential block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscontard and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, you don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free shit because free is not sustainable.
The comedy about sustainability is that you have to keep them behind.
I'm talking about giving people work, and getting kids out of the streets, and having them experience the joy of honor and honor when you build your own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to make sure that we will become all ecological reborm, gangsters, gang gardeners.
We need to turn the image of the lamps.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gangman.
You're going to have to go with a stutter, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up in a game of awkward chairs and want to make a meeting where you're talking about doing some shit.
If you want me to meet me, come with your curse, in my backyard, so that we can plant some napkin.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "nygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nonygoster" means "a-free political."
And yet, despite the 19th century, a newspaper publisher took a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who plays an office, independent of party, program or program or contract, and his success is achieved by the pure power of the monetial scientific decency."
I have no idea what the workress is.
I think something about it.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers were not given the exact same word of debugging.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with this extraordinary name called Brassp Crosby, who had a family member of Parliament.
They threw it into the Tower of London, and he loaded it, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to win, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence "so believe in Brassif."
Brusks the English word for tin.
But that's not true. It's going back to a secretary of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to America at the time when it just reached independence.
You're looking at the question of how to call George Washington, the head of the state.
You didn't know.
What is the leader of an Irish nation?
There's been endless debate about this in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible suggestions to this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-rurity George Washington, and others, proteitary defense of the people of the United States of America.
Not so sure.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was approved.
They were not monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored, because this debate had been three weeks.
I read the journal books of a Senate that always writes, "I've never thought the same topic."
The reason for the lacqual, and the boredom was that the House was against the Senate.
The Kansas House didn't want Washington to be a good job. They didn't want to.
The king are going to call it, and maybe it's going to be able to get ideas for its success.
They wanted to give him the most humble, stupid, driest title that they could think of.
This title was "Sisney."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before, but he only meant someone was running a gathering.
It's something like the predecession of a jury.
It had no longer the size of the record "Dear" or "Dearch."
Sometimes there were little colonial workers and government groups, but it was really unmanned title.
And so the Senate refused to drop it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him a president.
This guy must sign up the agreement and meet foreign bribes.
Who gets serious when he has a stupid little title like President of the United States?
And then, after three weeks, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, you're not going to use the word "diction" but they absolutely wanted to make sure that they were not willing to reconcile the ideas of the candidates, whether it's in the Republic or the monarchy where it's the office of the state, not necessarily imposed in favorable -- and not the president of the United States, and that the one is not the one that it is not worthy of the people's consent of the country.
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One is -- and I find it best -- until now, I can't figure out if the Senate has ever been officially officially called the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, she just called the title, and he's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something that's temporary -- wait 223 years later.
And thirdly, and this is really important, this is the most important point, is that the title of the United States today sounds so humorous, isn't it?
It's something that has to do with more than 5,000 nuclear swamps that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
History has given the title of size.
And that's how the Senate ended up winning.
They have a respectable title.
And the other worry about the Senate, the sounds of self-esteem, well, it was.
But you know how many nations there have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, and the Kansas House lost the representative house, because no one feels humbly when you're told that you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can carry with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually the reality changes much more than words that could ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
So I went to a truck with about 50 rebellors to fight thejalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would sit on my black Converse gloves against a pair of brown leathercalees and I would roll a rocket towards the government castle I could never even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And so long before I got to war, besides having been to do with Pyjama parties and football games on Samstakes and his racist South-state groups and surrient historians who lived with communism for a long time, and for Afghanistan, and forcatching and painting before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I stand here, I think, a common Afghans, South nations program of God Gnaden, an atheist, and a radically political artist who's been living last nine years in Afghanistan.
Well, there are many great things that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainworms. I want to make art mixed together and challenge authority and illustrate the reality and use the reality and even the kind of creative people to try and understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- west, jihad against communist, such as "Sopblood Bling," and use armed religious and political corruption to enrich itself.
And what else can jihad have done when it's for Parliament to run and make a choice campaign with the slogan, "Please choose me! I'm making jihad, and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi who spend as a national hero.
I want to leave the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called Rim's Rong, where you're a police, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and keep cars on them, but instead of taking bribes of them, provide money and delivered by the name of Kabul in America, hoping that they would take 100 percent of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the traditional conflict.
The war and the strange views that came along with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I create the deep fruits of local Afghan dress with a protective, or some recycled in a fashion-necoded arts effort.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan of Kabul looks like Kipling Appell from 1899 to create a dialogue about the current development organizations of the past colonial rhetoric about the White House to protect the brown man from behind himself and maybe even a little bit of civilized.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
And I do it because I have to, because the geography of self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your yours?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I've been working as a model for a while.
It's been said 10 years ago.
I feel that there's a very awkward tension in this room, because I shouldn't have that dress.
Fortunately, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is raising on the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness that this is what I think is.
If there were some women who were really smelling when I came out, you don't need to tell me this now, I'll read it later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged because I can change what you think of in a very short 10-second, very short period of time.
And it's not the chance everyone has.
These charges are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me off, so no, no, you're over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this image.
So, image is powerful, but image is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And this picture -- I had actually never had a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I could throw my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And apart from surgeries or false bollones that I took my time two days ago, there's very few ways to change our utterance, and our utterance is that even though it's superflusive and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
To be fearless is to be honest with me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this an sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a great heritage, and you might ask yourself what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we've been thinking of not only being healthy and young and primitive, in the way that admiration is programmed biologically, but also as big, oppressor and wines and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionist letters call me, "Haltomi, Tyra Sman Smwn." May."
And first of all, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, we've had a very ambitious Ph.D. student who's been counted all the modules on the runway, each of which was being arrested, and that 677 simulators are not only six percent.
The next question that's always being asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-Soc-Sater surgeon, which is completely wrong, because if you were the first one."
And when they say about this amazing trade line, they still say, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who the boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American birdhood or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like saying that you want to win the Jackor in the lottery.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
I want to show you 10 years of working model knowledge because, unlike heart surgery, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the client says, "Cameron, we want a photo going on," then the leg goes first, long and long, and long, this arm goes back, back to the back, the head is on the side of three and you're just moving back and forth, and you're going to see, you see, you see, you're going to be able to
It looks something like this.
I hope that it's less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and you've made a life cycle and you've done a few jobs, and you can't say much more, and if you say that you want to be president of the United States, but you're going to be saying, "10 years of underwear," you're going to look at weird.
The next question that's been asked me is, "Whoever do you want to collect the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are retured, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the very first photograph I did, and it was also the very first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have that period.
I know this is going to be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
And so I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the shootings.
My friend had to get involved with me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a biking for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and at V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you see that these pictures are not images of me.
They're constructed, and it's a group of professionals, by Hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and Stylists and all of their assistants and the reprocessives. They're not. I'm not.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You're doing things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot-cunk gloves I can never wear except for the things I get free, things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I drove with my friend, a horrible driver, and she passed over a red light, and of course it was stopped. It just took one "Sorry, Mr. Wachtmeister," and we could go on.
I got these costless things about my appearance, not because of my personality, and there are people who pay for their appearance and not pay a high price for their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 140 teenagers who have been stopped last year and shot, 85 percent black and Latinos and young men are young.
There are only 177 young young boys and male black and Latino who are not asking the question, "Who am I stopping?"
It's like, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
And in my research, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up at 78 percent when it became 17 percent.
The last question about me is, "How is it that we going to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little bit thinner and a darker hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And we have backstage a response that might be attributed to this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel as much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
It's true, but it's only half of the story, because we never say what I never said before the camera is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel unsure because every day I have to think about my appearance.
And if you ever ask, "I'd happier if I had little darker legs and darker hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most gloomy hair and the most cool dogry, and they're because of what their appearance might be, most insecure women on the planet.
When I'd done this talk, it seems very difficult to me to move an honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to sit here and say, "I got all the benefits of a stack that was being drawn to my favor." And it doesn't feel very good for me to say, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult to use a heritage of oppression for gender and race when I'm one of the greatest users.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I find it great that before I got here, 10 or 30 years since my career has been lost, because I probably wouldn't say how my first job I was getting, or maybe not, I would not say how I paid college, which is so significant.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully that we all recognize the power of the image in our misconceptions and failures more.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile: "Son, Laddafi's Resistance. Have a fight for it.
But never will it be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been almost two years since the Libyan revolution has been inspired by the waves of mass-war in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I connected myself to many other Libyans, and beyond Slayens, to ask a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, Grandby women and men stood in the front row, demanded the end of the regime, held Slogans's freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've demonstrated some examples of courage by putting on the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from far from far from far from the far west, all the way to the south.
After a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
But Gaddafi also left a huge hospital, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the path.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regime has destroyed both infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I cured how many other women have reintroduced the civil society of Lyyas. We demanded a publicized and unintroduced transition to democracy and national purpose.
Near 200 organizations, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis, started in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybia, and with this unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops for the subject capacity of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the Peace Basy League, a movement of women, leaders of various different forms of life, whose goal is to join women's sociopolitical empowerment and to embrace our right-being with democracy and peace management.
In the elections, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and its own.
I was awarding a Department of Peace Coronic women to reach a vote that would give a law that would give every citizen, no matter what context to vote, and to vote for a national party, and to make a shift between political parties and female and European and vertical and vertical, and to make a constant match.
and we ended up being adopted and successful.
South Carolina won 175 percent of the national bank worker in the first election since 52 years.
But slowly, the euphoria had made sure the entire revolution, because every day we started to get new messages of violence.
We entered the news for the broadcasting of ancient mosques and Sufi songs.
Another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
After one morning, the suicide bombers were signed by the armed forces.
And indeed, every day we find out under the leadership of militias and their ongoing events against human rights prisoners and their misguception of laws and laws.
Our society, composed by a revolutionary spirit, polarized, distant from the ideals and principles -- freedom, dignity, social justice that they were beginning to.
Intent, purpose and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our discourse and the elections.
I'm here today to confuse that we, as a nation, have made the false choice and the wrong choices.
We have misbehakened our priorities.
Because the elections did not bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Has the hard-tuned and the change between female and male candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What's it then?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate the political of domination and endurance, both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gade, and the accidental.
Our society needs a national dialogue and convergence when it took the elections that ultimately strengthens the polarization and decoration.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop doing the laws of anger and demand a day of revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the Greath.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only appreciate the values, but also to argue: Gicenesty instead of revenge, cooperation instead of default.
These are the ideals that need a war of diffuse lybia desperately to reach peace.
Because peace has an alchemia, and in this alchemia, it's about the cross-connection of feminine and maskal view.
That's the true punching.
And we have to do that in general before we do sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam," peace, "is the word of the Good God, Shick."
The word "raem" again, which is known in all the late-rapt traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rail," "in mother-in-law, symbolized the female's homage, all of humanity, of the male and the female of all the peoples and all of whom have been outdated.
And just like the mother, the mother, the embryo, grows in the photo, is so much as the principal of the compassion is so much as the existence of the existence.
And so we were told, "My God's name is to put all the things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has pre-supported before my Groll."
We're going to be the case of all the greeges.
Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In the school, we were looking at the history of Kim Il's history, but we were not learning very much about the world out there except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was often wondering about what the outside world was, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea until it was to change a changeable time.
At the age of seven, I saw a public execution for the first time, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a sister's sister's sister.
And he said, "If you were listening to this, our five family members will not be the world anymore because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about it for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly after, I went over to the trainway, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A black woman stood on the floor, and a pentper child in her arm was blindly oblivious to the face of his mother.
And nobody helped them because everyone was busy taking care of themselves and their families.
The mid-19s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans liked to sacrifice, and many others survived because they ate grass, beetles and forest corinures.
And so the waste rate became increasingly, so that at night, everything was darkened for me, except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag that we sat in.
I was always wondering why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the Caribbean, which is part of the road between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vigorously and enabled North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that as the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China to the distance of famine.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take us 14 years to work together.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as a North Korean refugee. But soon I learned that it's not only extremely difficult, it's also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal migrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate in North Korea.
And one day, I was struck by my biggest nightmare when I was trapped by the Chinese police department and was sent to the police station.
And someone accused me to be Northern Korean, so they tested my Chinese names and made a lot of questions.
I was so afraid of this fear, I thought my heart would explode.
And then there was something unnatural that could come out, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "That was a misguided.
She's not a Northstore."
They let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are testing messages like Asyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released by tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans did not have so much luck.
Every year, there are tons of North Koreans being caught in China and rejected to North Korea where it's been tortured, imprisoned or publicly executed.
Even though I had been able to escape my happiness, many other North Koreans don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
and after learning a new language and finding work can be replicated in a moment in time.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was leaving South Korea a bigger challenge than I thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start my third language.
I also saw the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very diverged by 67 years because of the part of it.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstore's grandist?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't hurt me very easily, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the first test test at university.
Just as I became a normal call to my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Bronx government started taking the money that I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family forced to relay my family to a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as fast as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, ironically I took a flight back to China, and made me go to the north pole.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, more than 2,000 miles across China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got almost several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the speculation of everybody, and he started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I decided to go up and told him that she was a child-friendly, and I was a hermit.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to get to the Portuguese border, but I had to spend almost any of my money trying to bribe the borderline of Laos.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was imprisoned because of illegal border.
After I paid money and sold cash fees, my family was released in a month, but only after that, my family was reigned, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest blessings of my life.
I'd done everything to protect my family for freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Bronx's great message.
I went out and I went between the immigrants and the police department, trying to free my family, but I had not had enough money to pay for cash or money.
I lost all my hope.
And the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was pretty surprised that a stranger is looking for it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I declared my situation, and I couldn't go to a bank engine, and I paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about the whole heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to help the North Bronx people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The former outsient people who were known to me was a new hope that required North Koreans so desperately, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I, again, united in South Korea, but the freedom to gain is just one step.
North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, the professional education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family support, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so fortunate to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make hopeful North Koreans success with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I just have one request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide it, and he's going to divide it.
It's not greedy. He's not paying attention to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and he's just telling you, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to speak out of words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown needs to be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It has absolutely meaningless memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate fries, but he remembers the release of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the very first result of the teapleties on my arm had been punching my arm and Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't listen to you?
But a lot of people don't vote.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often went through and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and strengthened my soul was that although this was the case, even though it wasn't considered a normal one, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "authorism," it's a complex dysfunction of the brain that's influenced social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's different than an individual, and it's a little bit like Remi's.
And the world is increasingly likely to recognize every 20 minutes of autism, and while it's one of the fastest growing diseases in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been talking to autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was only three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And then, after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He's a lot of screaming.
He didn't want to play how the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in being at all.
Remi lived in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like making cars in a row of room, to attract the washing machine and to eat everything that was coming across him.
And as he got older, it became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the razor and the Frust and the never-be-be-be-the-the-the-white hyperactivity, something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never suffered.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's another way of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because with autism or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody has a gift in it. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change dies in the moment when we try to be anything else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Doc Edgerton has been enjoying us with awe and curiosity, and this photograph, with a project of an apple, and a unit of radiation for just a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're faster and we don't see the world with a million or one billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto Photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create slow-time-sound images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look out the outside of our view, or without an <unk>-ray image in our body, and really ask what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are several Fembyseconds -- I create a package of photons that's hardly a millimeter wide, and this photonsuit, this project, will move at speed, and, as I said, a million times a normal project.
So if you take this project of photons packs and shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's slow-looking?
So, this whole event.
So, think about this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanosecond -- so long as long as you have to go back this track -- but I need to slow this video to get the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photonsule pack that starts to move through and eventually break through the inside.
And part of the light is coming out the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Most of the photons eventually reach the shock of the bottle and explode into different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in the bottle that's streaming around.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back and take the same distance, and we slow the video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, one week? No, one year.
It would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about something still-life photography?
You can see again, like this waves the table, washing the Tom Street and the wall in the back.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It seemed to me that nature would paint this image, one photo, one light image, but of course our eye will see a unified image.
But if you look at these Tomate every time, you'll see that when the lights are streaming over the eats, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because Tom's got it all the way, and the light jumps around it, and it's coming back after a few hundred seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if it's a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you do a photograph with a short air age, you have very little light, but we're trying to make a billion times faster than the shortest air age, so you're not going to get any light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project called this photons pack, and we're drawing this over and over again with very clever synchrony, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make this Femto video that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do some really interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make things invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero: Can it be able to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to light on the door.
It's going to be crushing into the room, and part of it is reflected back on the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could exploit this multi-folded pattern of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
There's a soup behind the wall, and we're going to break the light off the door.
After our paper was published in theNature Communications Communications, it was taken out of Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to chop this light project and we're going to put it on this wall, and this photons pack will be all in directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then break the light, and then, again, reflect a part of the door of the broken light and a tiny fraction of the photons will then come back to the camera, but it will be interesting to all be slightly different at a time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique capabilities.
It's got a very good time-consuming, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, by doing that, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point of distance is.
And then, by turning a laser, we can take a raw image, which -- how they see on the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take many of these images, we can put dozens of these images together, and we can try to analyze the various light-papped patterns, we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got some more to do before we can make this work in the lab, we could build cars that avoid collisions and detect what's behind the curve, or we can look for survivors of survivors, by looking at light being reflected by open windows, or we can build final ice that can see deep in the body around Ok slapcard and also see Nepal.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, and why this is really a wake-up call for scientists, is now thinking about Femto photographer, because a new visual technology can actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as in Docton, even a scientist, is a science that has become an art of the ultra-fifth photography, and I realized that all this gigabytes of data that we're collecting every single time we're using, we can also create a new form of computer photography, with a time-limating color, and we can't even look at all that wave from time.
But it's happening here as well.
And when you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost recording at the speed of light, having strange effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture incredibly.
The sequence of what's happening in the world will appear in the camera in a more restile sequence, so by applying the specific relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So no matter whether photography is around, or creating a new visual imaging for medicine or new exhibitions, since our invention, we've all been able to open and hope that the "mines are the creative and the research community that we should be able to stop us from the megapotometer to the next dimension, to start to be able to be able to be able to turn our own time on the next dimension, and to start to be able to be able to be able to
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our people can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor in the street so many teaching scholars, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and scars and crosses.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying each other?
How can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being reassured by the huge eel that for hundreds of years, I've been giving loved loved loved loved, drunky shocks and trauma. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever ever visited, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most abandoned parts of America.
I live near this house, and I was thinking, how can I get it, and I thought about something that has changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came out and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I've felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it's given me clarity of the things that I've been interested in in in in in life now.
But it's hard for me to keep this view of the day.
It's easy to lose your daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a side of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard, and I wrote a bridge in the gaps: "I wish I die, I want everybody who came back, can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public.
I wasn't sure what I was expecting at the experiment, but the next day was completely filled, and it grew.
I want to share with you some sentences that were written by the people on the wall.
"I wish I'd die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I wish I die, I want to stand a full-term over the International Crisis line."
"I wish I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
I wish you know, I want to plant a tree."
I wish you know, I want to live "control."
"I wish I die, I want to keep it in my arms once."
"I wish I'd die." I want to be a chapcillry."
"I wish I die, I want to be myself."
It was neglected in a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to tears, to tears, to piss me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, in a new and obvious way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important for us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages that wanted to build a wall with their community. So my colleagues and I built a construction kit, and now in countries like Kasakan, South Africa, Australia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have when we have the opportunity to increase our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and delicate.
We're often held by talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The idea of death actually illustrates the life.
Our common places show us the best that we are as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, the people around us can not just help us to create better places, they can help us to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm involved in effective mathematics. I think a special problem for anyone who's been involved with aggressive mathematics is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to tell you what I do.
Now dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're delighted to see the Danish Ballett and Steber teams, as you'll see.
There's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a basic signal that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability, and that also makes it happen in my guest Janppult who was a ballet's still practicing at the time.
Over the years, we've done a lot of progress in treatment.
And yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer this disease, and they have to live with the most disreguable symptom like sword, killings, scarcity, and other things that cause that disease, and so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately, the only way to know is to know if there's a cure when we have an objective measure that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there are no other motor disorders of Parkinson's disease, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing that you can do is that this 20-minute test is in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would make a trained tour to the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have a expensive hospital worker.
It's 300 percent of the time that we're looking at in the neurologic unit.
And so I want to propose to you a non-conventional way that we're trying to achieve that, because we're all, in a certain sense, virtual, as the famous Jan Abpling.
So here's a video of the vibrating vocal tether.
This is what happens in the common state when someone's voice sounds. We can look at the coherent ballet dancer because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs when we create sounds, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2.
And you need a lot of practice like ballet.
Think about how long a child it takes to learn until it's learning.
By the way, we can control the position of vibrating vocal tapes, and the way the limbs are also the mood of Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom record, you can see an example of the irregular vocal evidence.
We always see the same symptoms.
Bad, weakness, cifiness.
The language is sometimes being blamed and weakened, and this is an example of the character for it.
And this effects of the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and a directation software combined with new machine learning that's already advanced, we can now find out where someone is in a game between disease and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
So how can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not non-invasive. The test is in neurologists.
Very little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. They're not done by the right things that are being done by experts.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very fast, they're actually going to take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If it's extremely cheap, you can use it in a very large scale.
And this amazing goals can be done with this.
We can reduce logistics difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from shared observation.
We can do cheap mass recruitment for clinical trials for the first time, and we can do it for the first time in the entire population.
We now have the ability to look for biomarkers for the disease before it was too late.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we're going to start Parkinson's disease-sitative.
With Aculab and patient's cameras, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data to reach those goals.
We have a call-bars that are three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's, can call cheaply, to leave a few cents, and I'll say that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of it, say, do we take 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happening is that the patient has to be told during the phone call that this person has a disease or not. OK.
Some of them won't get to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in many different circumstances, which is interesting. That's the conditions that are important because we're wired to choose to figure out which ones are the actual markers for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy is accurate.
It's much better.
My students, Thanasis -- I have to blame him because he's doing such amazing work -- has shown that it's working on the cellular network, which is enabling this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a improvement.
That is, people can call the phone, and they can call the test, and we could call people with Parkinson's disease, and they can take their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see my father's cows in the back, and the cows behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just wrapped in the south, and that means that wildlife can be left by the park any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning and I found her dead. It was horrible. It was our only Buug.
My tribe, the mid-ai tribe, believes that we'd come together with our animals and the heavens's orbit, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I learned lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our ancestors. They are also on this problem.
They kill lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park there's not enough lions.
I have a boy in my tribe who is between six and nine years in charge of his father's cows, and that's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lionbees fear fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried a bird's search.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the bird, they go back, and they come back, and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still here.
And they reach and kill our livestock.
And one night, I was listening to the stall. I was walking with a torch on the hand around him, and this time the lions didn't catch.
It's because lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working in my bedroom as a young boy all day, and I even took the new radio apart from my mother, and the day it almost took me around. But I learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a weather-in-shelf policy, and it shows if you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I turned a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little pearne from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is the battery that provides the battery, it provides electricity to the server. I call it a transformer.
And the Internet noise is flashing.
You can see that the halves show outwards, because the lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights flashing and the lions believe that I was walking around the bar, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been installed in our home, and since then, we have no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they work really well.
Now, my idea is now used throughout Kenya, including other predators such as hyenights or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention saved me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is committed to it, and it helps fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in together where there's no one there, and I'm showing the people how to use it.
I was just a boy in the savanna who was chewing his father's cows, and I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of them."
And this is me standing here.
I was invited to create an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to make names. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can do it together, side-by-side, with the lions, without any kind of argument.
Ash Ol<unk>n<unk>n. In my language, that means "I thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, well, I'm working on an electric fence. An electroconce fence?
Yes, I know that electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, right -- Yeah, I tried it a little while, but I've given the attempt back because I got a shot.
So, at the beginning, it's hard. Richard Turer, you're something special.
We're going to hire you every step of your walk, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Since I was old enough to have a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you my 15 favorite pictures; and I haven't done one of them.
There was no sort of executive, no style, no chance of shooting a picture, not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourist.
My story starts when I was in New York for a talk, and my wife took this picture, where I held my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57 and 5th birthday.
And just a year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same image.
Well, you can see where it's going to go --
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why do you not go to New York City and do a father's birthday ceremony to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a complete stranger, you're going to have your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one has ever been left with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these journeys would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just weeks taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that five years of the day it can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a shot moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to take a week in October, to keep time and change our time and how we are going to grow year year by year, not just physically but in everything.
Because while we always make the same image, our perspective changes as time as it moves to time, as it moves to the next few new milises, I can see the life with their eyes, how it deals with everything it sees.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect for every year.
Well, recently, as one of our trips we walked out, we suddenly stayed as they were, and suddenly they show a red brand on a dollkin, which they learned as a young child, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old about this particular place.
She said that she remembered her heart of her chest when she first saw the store for nine years.
And now they look up in New York, they look up in high school because they want to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but apart from those 15 pictures, I'm hardly a family photo.
I'm always the one who's doing the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image, and ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
BLEU = 26.83, 57.5/34.2/22.0/14.3 (BP=0.956, ration=0.957)
