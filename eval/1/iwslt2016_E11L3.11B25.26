When I was 11 years old, I was a night of the skiers being ditched.
My father heard on his little, gray radio show on the BBC show.
He was very happy to see what was rather unusual at the time, because he was the news that was typically depressing.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning I'll never forget.
A real school.
The Taliban was pounding the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned girls to go to school.
And so for five years, I was humiliated as a boy, and I joined my older sister who was not allowed to go on to school for no more than ever.
And so we could go to school, and we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so nobody could guess where we were going.
We're in our hidden books in shopping stores so it looks like we're going to buy shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was a bit like a good thing, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risked to our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
After all, the class suddenly had to fall out for a week because the Taliban had swallowed the alarms.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
For them?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family where education was more important and more likely to be valued.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
One of the outsider from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to send to school and was distracted by his father.
My grown mother became a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement just to turn our house into a school for girls and women out of the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- was the first person in his family ever received an education.
For him, it was always clear that his kids were going to get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much greater risk of sending his kids not to school.
I remember that in the years, while I was so frustrated by the Taliban, we were so frustrated by our lives, of perpetual fear and the perspective of immission.
I thought I was good to give up, but my father said, "Tin-daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing that's going to keep you there is that what's in there. And even if we need to pay our blood to your school fees, we'll do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed in the war for decades.
Less than six percent of women, my age, have a higher degree than the Sek-D degree, and when my family hadn't used so much to my education, I would be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudly in the middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was ripped away from his family, because he was so afraid to send his daughters to school, one of the first people that was advised me.
He doesn't just throw it up to my high school, but also that I was the first woman to be driving through the car in Kabul.
My family thinks to me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for education in women.
And so I helped to start making SOLA, which is the first online board for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school school school nurse is still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my high school want to experience the ambition of all of them to their most recent odds.
And to see their parents and fathers, for them, as well as my parents were standing up for me, despite all the other concerns.
As Ahmed. It's not really his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and she's about to escape the death of a bomb on the side of the road for a few minutes.
When he arrived at home, the phone ranged, and a voice would crash him, if he sent his daughter to school, she would try it again.
And he said, "Well, I'm sorry now, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the game because of your old-great-white and pre-lived imagination."
In Afghanistan, as I've realized something that's often going to be done in the West, in the end of us, the majority of us who have succeeded is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realizes that their success is also your success.
And that's not to say that our mothers don't want to play an important role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are more likely to be more and more compelling and more compelling, a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely unaware of.
Under the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be looking like America, so different.
Americans realize how uncertain these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the lengths, and they're changing with the decline of the U.S. troops.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them to encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unconciliation, and remember that every day, the girls, go to the SOLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as a profession -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as young man.
1971 to 1971, I look young -- but I'm not -- -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, I've been working on the Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO project, and every single project we put on my legs failed.
I was desperate.
I was 21 years ago, thought that we are a good person in Italy, and we were successful in the work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we used to do.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book in Zurtles, the Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias, how to grow food.
We got together with Italian seeds in South Zambia, in this fring valley, which leads to Sambesi's Flub, and we taught the local citizens to grow the Italian tomato and pcini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they also came up.
And we were amazed that there was no such a fertile valley in which we were not going to have agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God you're here!"
"Mouch still at time to save the people of Sambias before the star starvation."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these gorgeous tomatos. In Italy, they became so large, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Sambults, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato muscle got red and red, about 200 palleys of nests were coming out of the river and they were laughing.
We said to the Sambins, "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great at Italy, but then I saw what Americans were doing, what the English world did, and after I saw what they did, I was proud of our project in Zambia.
We actually fed the kidney.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we didn't have yet given to our African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a C-Cian economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion Euros in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was doing.
Just think of her book.
Think about a African woman who did what we've done.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we hypwever them, or we are patriarchists.
Both words come from the Latin root, which means "fater," which means "fater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I'm going to treat every culture of another culture as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm saving every culture of another culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "batcel, head.
I became gagten when I read the book "Sesall" of Beautiful" by the singing. He said, especially in the economic development, if people don't want help, they leave you alone.
That's the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This conference, this morning, opened up, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolic colonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people and invented a system called the company who never started to be re-inemed, never get a motivated, but you become the local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you sit down with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet ourselves in cafes. We meet ourselves in kipars.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friend's friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like what you're supposed to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in human history.
We're going to help them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
So the person with this idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this failure: Why not to come to a community and say to people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have part of it, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
So programming has a look at this blind spot.
The most cleverest people in the community don't know because they never seem to be at the public meeting.
We're working on one thing to do, and we have to do this, and we have to make a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the home hospital, the hospital of the business, who's sitting in your house, sitting in your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the means to transform your passion in a way of making life happen.
I tried this in the Adperance, West Australia.
I trained at the time, and I tried to avoid the disbelief of the way we say what to do, what to escape.
And so I walked through the streets in the first year, and I had my first three days of customers. I helped him. He was in a garage, he was Maori, and I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perthto, and then the fishermen came up, and said, "You know, you helped Maor?"
I helped these five fish, and I couldn't work together and sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents of KKilo, but to Japan sushi for 15 dollars. Then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them doo?"
So a year ago, I had 23 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk>?" I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I hold my mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- So the government says, "Do you want to do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the process of making it.
There's a new generation of companies that go on loneliness.
So Peter printer, one of the best business CEOs in history, died with 96 years ago.
So Peter's printer was philosophy professor before he was working on companies. Peter's printer said, programming is actually unconcompable with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So planning is the death of the entrepreneur spirit.
So you build Christchurch to know, without knowing what the smartest human being wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get you to one.
You have to offer them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get out of the box.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
For the talk, you've got the most applaudy here today?
"Sear, passionate people. You applaud this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-contistency fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing, so suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn machine is not sustainable.
The open-source way is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, create, transport, transport them, and share them with them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Are universities? Forget it!
Government? Forget it!
It will be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a pre-urventist magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to talk about the future of the city in New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they were speculated, which would happen in the city of New York in 100 years ago, and the conclusion was a mainly: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grew up at this rate, they needed six million horses to get people to do it, and it's impossible to get the crap done by six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
And they see 1860 of the dirty technology that's buried in New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive manufacturer in the United States -- 1001.
So the idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were tiny factories in the back of the country.
And then, Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be offered discretion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next thing you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest company to the biggest company, all of these needs to be able to do three things: to sell the product, which is to be great, the market market market market, and the financial justice needs to be huge.
You guess what?
We never met one person who's going to produce something at the same time, sell, sell it to save money.
That's not what it doesn't exist.
This person was never born.
We've done research and we've looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wedownhouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have been common, only one: none of them were founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 year-old graduates in North Korea, and we start teaching them the first two pages of Richard Brers's Autobiography, and the job is the 16-year-old girl, in the first two sides of Richard Bransian Autographing Autographies, how often he used the word "e" and "we" and "we" and "we"
Never once, 32 times, "we."
It wasn't just when he started.
No one company alone, no one. Nobody built one company.
So we can create a community where the facilitator has a small entrepreneur background, sitting in cafeteria and Bars, and your partner, who are going to do what someone in this gentleman did about this gentleman who speaks about the E<unk>s speaking. Somebody tells you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting organizations to help them find the means of the means of the means of the means of the means of the people, and we found that the wonders of the local population, that the culture and the economy can change, just by the passion, energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how to be, Alice in the miracles country.
The University of Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to try to divide engineers in communication.
I was afraid.
Fear. Fear with these students with their large brains and their large books and their large, I don't trust myself.
But when the conversation evolved, it used to me as Alice, as she walked down, to the Canon's house, and a door on a completely new world.
And I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed about the idea that they had, and I wanted to find that other of these miracles.
I think to open up these towers, it requires great communication.
We need to really have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the biggest problems, like energy and environmental and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and we don't understand it, then it's not going to go forward. I think that it's our responsibility as a non-religious scientist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please, please, please, hang on.
So I want to show you some of the approaches that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy doing is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, okay?
Let's tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
It doesn't just tell us that their whilch is being studied, but also tells us that her kines are doing their kisses, the spinner-like structure in our bones, looking at it, because it's important to understand osteoposis and treat it.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not preventable-course.
Now, in the words, there's a barrier to understanding your mind.
Now, surely you could use your "fight and time" and yet, why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
We're not going to make our mind understandable, it's not the same as you're going to turn down your level.
As Einstein said, "Take things just as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can tell us something about your scientific field without having to compromise compromise.
Some things are about this. Some examples, stories and analogies. So this way, you can pull us into your hann.
And if you present your work, let's throw the spots away.
Have you ever wondered why it's called "all point?"
What happens when someone gets to mind? Another one is going to be cut, and with these dots, the first one, your audience.
So a slide like this is not boring, but it's also too much about the conversation that we're talking about, and that's how we're getting excited about it.
This example of Gene Bonve Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of the feather is so robust that it actually was the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffviemck.
So the trick here is to use a single, easy sentence to try to perform, where the audience is going to lose the thread, it can be re-pussive, it uses images and graphs that are also going to address our other senses and it creates a deeper understanding of what they describe.
These are just a couple of ways that can help us open up these towers and see the wonders country that are engaging science and technology.
And because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to try to make contact with the "Nerdat" in me, I want to sum up everything with a equation.
Look at your science, and your discourse, you have these redundant words, and they share it through the popular, so the audience tells you what's important, and they multiply the whole thing that you have with your incredible work, and that's where you can imagine the most unfinished interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I really felt like I was concerned.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can actually film a crime in the history of mankind in Syria.
You can start a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And then you can take a song and you can record it up on the soundCloud and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were walking on the street for change and demonstrated.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all these people who were coming in and asking change and change were having a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost every one of them today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how my life has changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35830 lines full of information.
Pove data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, E.U.R. embassy has set up a rule.
So this is a policy line called the Forest Forest Management Reservation.
And the rule of this line is that every phone company in Europe, any Internet service provider in the entire Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who is going to send an email?
Who is sending a text?
And when you use a cell phone, where you are.
All of this information will be stored at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are up, and they said, "We don't want to do that."
They said, we don't want to have the supply of this trade.
We want to control self-confidence in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to do that."
And here you can see, tens of thousands of people migrated on the streets of Berlin and said, "Foury instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be the turn of the turn of the line, 2.0.
The Stower was the headcatchini in eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is it really going to work?
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declitz Telegraph, who was the biggest phone company in Germany at the time, and I asked them, I asked them, send all the information that you've stored on me.
And I asked her once, and she said, "Well, I didn't get a right answer. Just a half-eaning Bla."
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's tracking it.
So I decided to put a court process on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telegraph said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison.
I'm going to pull back the counterage to which they were asking me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court decided that the introduction of E.U.R. was the rule of law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35830 lines of information.
At first I saw it and I said, well, it's a giant date. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm asleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what the U.S. Security Council means.
So with time online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go ahead and go back and forth.
You can track every step I do, track it.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt to the train to K<unk>nnn, and how many calls I'm going to run along.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes you a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I call my wife and she calls me to me, and we talk a couple times.
And then a couple of friends call me up, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, which are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who you're talking about who's talking to who you're sending email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins had had cell phones in their pocket in the fall of 1989,
And the dower knew who was about to do that, and when the bells knew who the leader had been, that maybe this would never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And then not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so many information as they can get about us, online and online.
They want the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store all of this stuff in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not an old-fashioned one.
If you go home, you say your signature, just because companies and government are the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company to go to the information that you've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight yourself's rights in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central. The spiral stores, rapid restaurants, Brakill spaces.
So the city map meet and changed the name of South Central, so that he was standing for something else, and they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that's changing what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
In the wake-up shops, rapid restaurants, Brakill spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivethr, and the Drivebys.
The comal is that the Drivethrus kills more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles for unhealthy diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is higher than five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really see that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to food, if you were going out of the house, you see the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I've made sure that rollmill is bought and sold as a source of transport.
I see dialogy centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what we have to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like a minute-old kid to get an apple that's not particularly pre-fetched with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat from my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the parking lot.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay in the seat."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grass, and we started to plant my food and fruit trees, the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of high-tech group, put together by all the social layers and from the entire city, and it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then somebody complained.
And the city came to me and he was basically putting me a station and said that I needed to remove my garden, which was a propulsion to a rifle.
And I thought, "Well, come on, really?
A conformation of food from food in a piece of land that doesn't matter you?
And I thought, "Cool. Her name.
Because this time it wouldn't go on.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and he talked to the city center, and with a member of Green Ground Ground, and she was a petition on Change.org, with 900 regulations, we were successful.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My town even called up and said they are supporting it and loving what we do.
So really, why don't they do that?
LA.A. has the largest hardware in the United States in the possessions of the city.
They own 67 miles in Brakill spaces.
This is 20 Central Park.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell shouldn't you find that well?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my beat message, I say people who are supposed to grow their own food.
to grow its own food as if it's a little bit like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I feel more confident to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I made my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
So gardenwork is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls are gracking, I swear my lawn and the park plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my trappings for this stuff.
You might be surprised what the ground can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You might wonder how kids are going to be influenced by this.
So gardeners are the most therapeutic and the most exciting act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you can get strawberries.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came in, it was about 10:30 in the evening. They were in my backyard, and I got out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason in the street."
I felt annoying when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just made me realize that I was only empowered to do this. People said, "Well, you don't fear you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum Devil, no, I'm not afraid that they're going to see what's going on.
And it's still on the street.
And that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
Another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in Downtown, L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to get the truck out.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even if it was just for a moment.
Green Grass has already grown up about 20 gardens.
and we got 50 people out of our plaque stations and we did it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
If they don't get any of them, if they're not shown, how food and bodies are affected, they eat blind, whatever you're talking about.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids that are just on the path that they're looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere else.
And I see the garden as an opportunity to train these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood block in gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscontard and turn it into a healthy cafeteria.
So, you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-corking, because free is not sustainable.
The comry of sustainability is that you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and getting them to get the joy and the pride and the honor of getting them built when you build your own food, and when you open the farmers markets.
So, what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to make sure that we will become all ecological rebels, gangdresses, gangfly gardeners.
We need to turn the picture of the gang star.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gang.
You'd have to start walking around with a diner, right?
And let's be the gun of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't tell me if you want to sit in the wrong chairs and make a meeting where you're talking about making some of the bells.
If you want to meet me, come with your shutter, in my backyard, so that we can plant some picks.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford dictionary is "nnnnolly-didaster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nnnolly monaster" means "n'tomless politician."
And yet, despite a newspaper publisher, a better definition, "A Snolly Holloster is somebody who complained to a office, independent party or program or postfunding, and his success of the pure power of the monumental decoderical decency."
I have no idea what the "chouse" is.
Something that I think is a little bit like.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
171, for example, the British Parliament were not allowed to publish newspapers, the exact same word of debutors.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who had a story with the parliament.
And she threw it to the Tower of London and he was brave, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to say, to the end, and he ended up having so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first post-mixing for the phrase "so" as much as Brassif."
Brasshell is on the English word for a tin.
But that's not true. It's going to go back to a failure of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are interacted, I want to take you to the United States, at the moment when it's just their independence.
You're looking at the question of how to call George Washington, the state state state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader a Dutch nation?
and that's what the conversation was published in Congress for a long time.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions to this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the governor Washington, and others, his high-rurity George Washington, and again, the foundation of the freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
Not so much of that.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that's what it's known.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could work. It could have worked.
But everyone was bored in the room because this debate had three weeks of bored.
I read the days of a Senate that always writes, "I've kept thinking about the same topic."
The reason for the delay and the long was bored is that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a kier. They didn't want to be a man.
And then, king, and maybe even give it to ideas of its own.
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most destest, the most destest title they could think of.
This title was "Pisith."
President. They didn't invent the title. But he just meant that somebody was running a meeting.
It's something like the endurance of a jury.
It didn't have the size as the term "Dear" or "Dearry" or "Doney."
Sometimes, there were little colonial groups and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
And so he refused to stop the Senate.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to sign up the agreement and meet foreign-tollaster stations.
Who's going to take it seriously when he has a stupid title like President of the United States of America?"
And then, after three weeks, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, you're not going to be called the "discovering" word, but they absolutely wanted to make sure that they were not agreed for the opinions of the opinions and the institutions of the nations, whether they are in the Republic of the state, where the official "to-the-the-sided" -- not to the end-themap-them the world -- and the people who are not agreed to do so, not with the rest of the rest of
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One is -- and I think it's the best -- so far I can't figure out if the Senate ever demonstrated formalized the name of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just called me the title. He just wait for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government tells you that something temporary -- you'll wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is this the most important point, is that the title of "The United States of America today sounds so uneasy, right?
It's something more than 5,000 nuclear wasteheads that he has and the largest economy in the world and a flap of drones and all that stuff.
and reality and story have given the title of the size.
And this is how the Senate ended up going.
They have a respect title. They have a respect title.
And the other worry about the Senate, the head of self-sixness -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, and the representative hospital lost, because nobody feels humbling when you say you're the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but actually, the reality changes more than words that the world could ever change.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck about 50 rebellion to the war of Mr. Dealabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would love my black Conclimate to a pair of brown leatherers and a bakery to the state of government war that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And so far before I was born on the war, besides Pyjama party and football party, I started to Sam and I joined the racist South Africa and Irient Interconial demonstrations, which lived with no communism and Afghanistan and Concluse the most of the time before I knew what I knew was going on.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm a more educated Afghans, South states of God Gnnn, an atheist, a radically political artist who lived last nine years in Afghanistan, and I've created.
So, there are plenty of cool things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainworms. I want to make art that makes love to fill together and challenge authority and brochure and reality and even using a kind of delightful human archive to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad --GT, who calls the jihad against communists like <unk>-Copop-Sop<unk>, and he was using these arms-lillating and political corruption to enrich himself.
And what else can be the jihad-ford, as for the parliament, to do a choice campaign, to the slogan, "Wake me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi who spend on national heroes.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Ronging," where you put a policeman, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes from them, giving them money and saying that in the police department, and they hope that they would take the 100 percent of us to the United States.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my view, the Cropal conflict.
The war and the stranger's view that came along with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion training for soldiers and suicide bomber, where I created the Tow of Honors with a protective or even several different torgles in a neochial effort.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan of Kabul looks like Kipling Appellell in 1899 to create a dialogue about how today's development organizations have their origins in the past colonial rhetoric about the White Dictionaries to protect the brown man and maybe even a little bit of a civil society.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misdirected.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of self is supposed to require it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I've been working on as a model for a while.
It's been said 10 years ago.
I feel like you're building a unconventional tension in the room here, because I didn't have to dress this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit more change on this.
This is the first time that someone is walking on the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness that you're going to see that.
If some women were really shooking when I came out, you don't need to tell me this, I'll read it later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm a pretty privileged kid, because I can change in very short 10 seconds of what you think of me.
And that's not the chance of everybody.
These pressures are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the sweater above my head, because you'll all be waking me off, so you don't do anything until it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as awkward as this picture.
And a picture is powerful, but a picture is also super-ficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should put my back oil and my hand in the hair of this guy.
And apart from surgeries or the wrong clones I've been thinking about two days ago, there's very few ways to change our discourse, and our utteration has a lot of our utteration -- although it's a super-simport of the most disrespatic impact in our lives.
Fearless to be honest for me is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, how do you make a model?
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe you might ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have no idea of beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, in which it's a science that we're programmed to be biologically, but also as big, gay and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's been paid to me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this, and maybe some fashion provider calls, "Haltomi, Tyra. Joan Smelh. Wenh."
And first of all, I'm going to comment on your model. Very impressive.
But I don't think I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has counted all the modules on the runway, each single one that was dled, and that by 67700s, only 27 percent didn't know.
The next question that's always being asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can do everything.
You can become President of the U.S., or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Nintendin heart surgeon, which is completely wrong, because if you were the first one."
And when they say, well, after this amazing counter line, they still say, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for nothing, and you could be the head editor of American bird or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M; or the next Steven Meis.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like you'd say you want to win the Jackor in the serif.
You can't influence it, and it's amazing, and it's not a career way.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a trained model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be expanding.
If there's a photographer and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo in the run," then the leg goes up, and long, and then, all of this arm goes back to the back of the head, and you just go back and forth, and you see it, 300 times, you want to have your friends, you know, you know, 300 times back to your own friends.
It looks like this.
Hopefully less odd than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's happened.
If you finish school and you have a life cycle and you don't have much jobs, you can't say much more, and if you say that you want to be president of the United States, but you're going to be saying, "10 years of underwear," you'll be looking at weird.
The next question that I'm asked is, "Who's going to beat all the photos?"
And yes, so much of the photos are going to be re-inflicted, but that's just a little part of what happened.
This is the very first photo I did, and that was the very first time I had a Bikini -- I didn't even have that period at the time.
I know this is going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
And so I just saw a couple months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this shoot.
My friend had to come and join me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a bingering for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-D magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructs, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylist and makeup artists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the ex-replication. They are not me.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "You're the warets for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot-touch gloves I can never wear, except just because, the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I drove up with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was going to come over a red light and, of course, we were stopped. It took a "Searry, Mr. Words," and we could go on.
I've got this costless stuff because of my appearance and not because of my personality and there are people who pay for their appearance and not paying a high price to their personality.
I live in New York, and from 140,000 teenagers who were stopped last year and shot, 85 percent black black and Latino and often young men.
It's only 177 young, male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Who am I going to be fired?"
And he said, "How often am I going to be stopped? When I'm going to be stopped?"
In my research, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and this number goes up to 78 percent when they've become 17 percent.
And the last question I have to ask myself is, "How is it that it's a model?"
And I think they expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and darker hair, you have a very happy and wonderful one."
And we give backshads a response that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera I never said before, is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel not very uncertain because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happier if I had thin legs and darker hair?"
And then you'd find some modules, because they have the thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool stuff they're flamged, and they're probably the ones that look at their appearance, probably the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to me to move a honest journey, because on the other hand, I felt really uncomfortable to go here and say, "I got all the benefits from a stack that was being dragged into the comfort." And it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that's not always making me happy."
It was very difficult to do, a heritage of oppression and race, when I was one of the greatest uses of it.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great to find that I've made it here before 10 or 30 years since my career has been completely disrupted, because I wouldn't say how my first job was, or I might not say how to be a college, which is so important.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our madest failures and failure.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, craddafi, Faddafi. Have you heard the words.
But never get to something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been almost two years since the Senate has been shattered, inspired by the waves of mass-paval in both the works and the Egyptian revolution.
I connected myself to many other Libyers, and outside of Neighyens to try and challenge a day of anger and launch a revolution against the tyrannic regime.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, grand-granddaughter and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, held Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They've demonstrated an empirical mutant by putting on the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They showed a strong sense of solidarity, from far east to far west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, it made us realize to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
But Gaddafi still left a large burden, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the course of the course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's dilemma has destroyed both infrastructure and the culture and the moral structure of the lyy-bian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I used to call the many other women who are building civil society of Lyybas, and we asked ourselves to be a passive and transition to democracy and national equilibrium.
Near 200 organizations were founded, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exil, I came back to Lybia, and I started working with unique enthusiasm, and I started to organize workshops to the issues of working development, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform of women, a movement of women, leaders of different forms of life, whose goal is to be public-based empowerment for women, and to consider our right-sexance of democracy and peace management.
In the case of the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and execution.
I was a campaign of peacebuilding organizations to reach a vote-driven law, a law that would give citizens any other citizens, no matter what context to choose and to vote, and, above all, to create political parties between two and third-level leaders and to make a constant tag.
At the end, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the national bank worker in the first elections since 52 years.
But long, but certainly the euphority of the election and the whole revolution, because every day we started to get into new messages of violence.
We were thinking about the leadership of ancient mosques and Sufi sons.
In another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to the message.
After another morning, the suicide bombers were signed by the army.
And so literally every day, we are at the rule of the military and their ongoing events against human victims and their misferences of laws and laws.
Our society, composed by a revolutionary mentality, polarized, distant from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice that they had initially stopped.
So, intolerance, rejection and revenge became the icon of the <unk>Fol<unk> era of revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our discourse and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to say that we've made a nation that's made false choices and wrong choices.
We've answered our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the hardest and change between female and male candidate leaders have brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate the culturally aggressive politics of dominance and endurance, both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only one that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the gade and the union.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus that it took to the elections that ultimately strengthen the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs more than the female's internal embodiment than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop acting in the name of the ravion and demanding a day of the revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't necessarily lead the values, but also to say, "Gade, instead of revenge, instead of working, instead of not a competition, not a compliment.
These are the ideals that need a war of razy las desperately to reach peace.
Because the peace has an alchemie and in this alchemie, it's about the cross-caping of feminine and maskal view.
That's the real alignment.
And we have to do that in general, before we do it sociopolitical.
After a stop from the Koran, "Salam" -- peace, "the word of the Good God, slush."
The word "raheem", again, which is known in all of the lateham tradition, has the same Arabic root as the word "lrawn" -- and symbolizes the mother's mother's motherly feminine, all of humanity, the man's sex and the female, all of the peoples.
And just like the mother's mother's junior growing in his life, it's so much of the rest of compassion that's ever served.
And so we were told, "My Godllain gives all things."
And so we were told, "My Gade's pre-songed before my fortune."
And we'll all be allowed to be the art of the gade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In the school, we were looking at the history of Kim Il's history, but we didn't learn much about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea to get a change in anything.
At age seven, I saw a public construction opening, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer hunger myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter, a sister of mine.
And they said, "If you were to be here, our five-thirds of the family members are not going to be in this world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're stuck in the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people were eating in my country.
Shortly after I went to the train station, and I saw something horrible that I can't get away from my memory.
A squat of a woman was lying on the ground, and a pentper-trenched kid in her arm looked helpless in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because all of them were busy to care for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'99s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans liked to sacrifice, and many others survived, because they ate grass, beetles and celpine.
And so the incidents became increasingly more and more likely to be worse at night, except for the lights from China to the other side of the dung that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't have lights.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of amp still part of the place between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vigorously and enabled North Koreans to escape.
Many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies moving into the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the devastating years of famine to the relatives that were sent to China.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it took 14 years to work together.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have any idea of how life would be like a North Korean refugee refugee. But soon I learned that it's not just very difficult but also dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
And then one day, my biggest nightmare was recognized when I was caught up from the Chinese police department and sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be Northern Koreans, so they tested my Chinese certificate and made me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
And then, dignity seems unnatural, I could be locked and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made it possible to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the poll, a official said to the other one: "That was a wrong conclusion.
She's not Northstoreman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Look at some North Koreans in China who are foreign messages like Asyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls were lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released because of tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China, and they're already announced to North Korea, where they're tortured, imprisoned or publicly.
Even though I was lucky enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard for survival.
and after she's learned a new language and work, her world can be replicated in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was going to leave South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I was going to have.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I also realized the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of us we've been very diverged from a very linear part, because of 67 years.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstore's CEO?
Where am I from? Who am I?
And suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't get much worse, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording at the university.
Just as I became a little more normal in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started taking the money I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family forced to move around, to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to go back an amazing route to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China and made me go to the southwest border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them to more than 2,000 miles across China and then go to South Asia.
The bus drive lasted a week, and we got nearly thousands of hits.
Once, when the bus was held up, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the branch of everybody, and he started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I decided to stand up and told him that she was a dent, and I was a her boss.
He looked at me, and he was laughing, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get it all the way down to the Portuguic border, but I had to avoid almost all my money to get the borderline of Laos's hist.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated, because of illegal border.
After I paid money and golf fees, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was reigned, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the greatest blessings of my life.
I had done everything to defend my family to freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Korean message.
I went down and I went to the out of the immigrant department and the police department, trying to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for the bribe or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger was complaining about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and no such thing, he went to a bank engine, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him all about heart and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The earlier stranger, I think, symbolized by a new hope to me, who needed to have the North Koreans so much hope, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope of the North Koreans,
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I've been united in southern Korea, but the freedom is only a step.
North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, learning the English learning, the professional education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family institutions, and we send them information and money that helps change North Korea from the inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to be a hopeful North Koreans to be successful with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, very high-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide them, and he's going to divide them in the air.
It's not lousy. It doesn't look at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine saying, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to be a little bit like words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of a thing: how little we know about the minds and how amazing the unknown needs to be.
Samuel is 16th. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It has absolutely unknow memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate fridge, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four times the first result of the teaplet on my arm and Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't you hear it?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often have been understood and wrong.
But what motivated my heart and my soul was that, although that was the case, although it was not as common, it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- with autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "demism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that affects social communication and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a trick in every individual, so it's Remi's so different from Sam.
And the world is going to see every 20 minutes in a new person of autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been living with autism, but I can't remember myself any day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He's a lot of a wolf.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem really interested in me at all.
Remi lived in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine in a space, and eating everything that was coming under him.
And as he got older, it became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the razor and the dustles and the never end of hyperactivity was something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had to suffer.
Except extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things they've taught me about individuality, communication and communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normalality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be like you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody has a gift to us, and in all of us all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change dies at the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Doc Ederton has filled us with awe and curiosity, and this photo on a project that's been collected by an apple and a long-term radiation period of only a millionthth.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new engineering technology that's so fast that it can create slow-time-speed footage of light.
And so we can build cameras that are looking at the outside of our view, looking down at corners, without an <unk>-ray image in our bodies, and really ask what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it in a <unk>1 billionth of a second -- these are several Remto version -- I make a package of photons that are barely a thin, and this photonsuit, this project, which is moving at the speed of light, and as I said, a million times faster than a project.
So, if you take this project, this photons pack, and you put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's the picture of light in slow motion?
So, this whole event --
So, think about this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanotipip -- so long as long as you have to take the light back of that route -- but I'm going to try to make this video the factor of the 10 billion billion to see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle with a photons pack, which starts to move through it, and that eventually breaks in the inside.
And part of the light, it's moving out to the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Most of the photons are ultimately reaching the tail of the bottle and explode into different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in the snow that's in the bottle.
And meanwhile, the waves are coming out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a general project and you take it back and you take the same route back, and you can slow it back the video, and you know, the factor of 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here to see the film?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a still life photographer?
You can see again, the waves of the table, the Tomber and the wall on the back of it.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature would paint this picture, each of them, one photo image, but of course, our eye will see a collection of imagery.
But if you look at these Toms, you'll see that when the lights are streaming over, the lights are going to be kept, that's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is mature, and the light in your way is going up and it's coming back after a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if there's a fruit, without touching any of them.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of air long, you have very little light, but we have a billion times faster than your shortest air age, so you get as little light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons pack, and we're drawing it, and we're going to draw it back and forth with very clever synchronization and combine this gigabytes of data to make this wireless video, and I showed you what I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future supercomputer: Can you see corners?
And the idea is that we're going to light on the door.
It's going to be tilt into the room, and part of it is reflected back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use these multi-fold-through-cuttered-cuttering-pulling-pulling-pulling-pempression-pempression-pempression-pempression units.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left side, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden, and we'll be able to put the lights on the door and down the door.
After our paper was published in theNature Communications, it was taken out of Nature.com, and they created these animation.
We're going to be re-use the light project, and they're going to be tipping back into this wall, and this photons pack are going to be all over and reach out the photons in all directions, and some of the photons are going to reach our hidden soup that will then break the light, and then the door will then reflect a little bit of light and a tiny fraction of the photons back to the camera, but they'll be very interesting
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And by doing that, we know the distance from door to door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is to be heard.
So by putting a laser on, we can take a raw image, which -- how you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense -- but if we take lots of these pictures, dozens of these images, and we put them together and try to analyze the different light walls, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a little bit to do, before we can do this in the lab, we could build cars that are able to avoid and detect what's going on in the curve, or we can look in dangerous levels of growth by looking at light, and we can build the windows, or we can build finalopes that are in the body, to look deep, and to the right-didhill, and to the cridepill.
But because of the eagle and tissue, of course, this is a very challenging thing, and that's why this is a call for scientists, now, to think about Ftoto-Map photographer, because a new imaging process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging.
So, like a few seconds, even a scientist, a science has become a art that has become an ex-fight photography, and I realized that all this gigabytes of data that we collect every single time, not just a scientific image, but we can also create a new form of a computer scan with the color and color repeatings, and we can just look at it between us.
But it's something that happens here.
If you look at the waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're going to take almost in the speed of light, we've got weird effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly, really.
So the sequence that's happening in the world is coming in the camera, in a process of sequencing, so by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct these biases.
So, don't care whether photography is going to be around or creating a new imaging tool for medicine or new exhibitions, since we've been able to open all the data and the details on our site and hope that the "filders are the creative community to show us that we should stop to step up to the megapow, to start to step up the next scale -- to us -- to start to step up to the next scale.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our fellow beings can improve our lives.
We don't make any neighbors on the street so many of the talks are not going to be passed, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and scars and crosses.
And the projects came from my questions, how much rent do you pay to my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities have reflected our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being restored by the giant euths that had been woken to the last hundreds of years, drunk and shuttery shadows, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time anyone ever ever ever ever ever imagined, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are also the city with most of our abandoned houses in America.
And I'm walking around this house and thinking about how I could pass it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came out and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in in in life now.
But I'm feeling hard to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose your life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the house into a giant board, and I wrote a bridge in the gaps: "I want to die, I want to die," everyone coming, can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and their hopes in this public.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day was completely filled, and it grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I want to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I want to die, I want to be a broad-term about the International Recider."
"I want to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I want to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die, I want to live sub-control."
"I want to die, I want to keep them in my arms."
"I want to die, I want to be a different piece of paper."
"I want to die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and to the shooks and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's a new and urgent way of understanding them.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and thinking and remembering what's most important for us to grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I made a buildingbox and now became a building company in the world like Kasazan, South Africa, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces, when we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, to look at things that are right in the right way, and to think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often discriminated to talk about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The idea of death makes us feel life.
Our common places are the best important thing that we have as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities, our hopes, our hopes, to share fears and stories, that people can't help us to make better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in effective math, a special problem for anyone who's involved in the act of being more aggressive math is that we're like business designers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to explain what I do.
And dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're excited by the sight of the Dander Ballett and Steberers, as you'll see.
There's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities that are known, and possibly a fundamental predictive that a genetic component might have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability, and that's what it does for me to know about my bossan Strir, who was on his time a ballet's attertion.
Over the years, a lot of progress has been done in treatment.
And yet, there are 6.3 million people in the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unhealthy symptom of weakness, killings, killings, scarcity, and others that are causing that disease, and so we need objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know is to know whether there's cure, if we have a objective scale to answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there's no more control of Parkinson's disease, so you can't do a simple blood analysis, so the best thing that you can do is that this 20-minute test is the neurologists are looking at.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it never will.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would make a more tour of the hospital? What if patients could do this test yourself?
It wouldn't take a teasing hospital.
It costs 300 percent to study in the neurological unit, by the way.
And so I want to propose to you that I think that an unconventional approach that we're trying to do this, because we're all all, in some sense, virtual, virtual nuos like my guelpler.
So here's a video of vibrating vocal rays.
This is what happens in the healthy state, when someone is creating a speech gun, we can look at the coherent ballage dancers, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs, if we can make the sounds, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2,
And like ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it comes to talk.
And by the way we can click on the position of vibrating vocal sounds, and so the limbs are also affected by the mood of Parkinson's brain.
On the lower record, you can see an example of irregular vocal scars that are made of evidence.
We always see the same symptoms.
Sincere, weakness, dastriness.
And the language is even more and more agile, and that's an example of the book.
And so this effects of the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and the risk analysis of analysis, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, so we can now figure out where somebody's in a radio and health, just because of the sounds of the voice.
So how can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not the uninvasive. The test is the neurologists.
Not so little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build a new clinics for this.
And both of them are exactly exactly the same. They're not going to be done by experts.
So they can be done by themselves.
They're very fast, very much pereplee of 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're extremely cheap, you can use it in a really large scale.
So this amazing goals we can do now.
We can reduce logistics difficult to patients.
Patients don't have to do routine interfaces in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data by over-term observation.
We can do cheap mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we can do the first study of the entire population.
We now have the possibility to look for biomarkers to look for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're starting to start the Parkinson's room.
With Aculab and patient's first bike, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data to get the best of these goals.
We have a callar numbers that are available to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anybody with no Parkinson's disease can call cheap footage to leave a few cents. I'll say that we've already seen six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you look at samples, we say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to be told in the call, whether this person is suffering from Parkinson's Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them might not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, in different circumstances, which is interesting. Those conditions are important, because we're wired to put these things up to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is on?
It's much better.
My students, Thanasis -- I have to give him a little bit of money, because he's done so amazing work -- has now shown that it works on the cell network, which allows this project to do, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
That is what people can call -- people can call the phone and call the test, and people could call them Parkinson's disease, and they could send their voice to the doctor to check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the south edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see my father's back in the background, and behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a small-looking place in the south, which means that wildlife animals like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found her dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buett.
My tribe, the stem of the massai, believes that we were going to come together with our animals and the Farid Sea, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I learned lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans, and they protect our tribe and our ancestors. They are also given for this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years is responsible for the cows of his father. So that's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but to help the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't have me up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird.
I wanted to think that the lions thought I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You'll come, you see the bird, you look at it and you go back. You'll come back to the next time, and you'll come up and say, this thing doesn't work, it's still here.
and they reach out and kill our livestock.
And one night, I would wake up the rack. I would walk around with a torch, and I would not catch the lions up.
And the way that lions fear light is moving.
I had an idea.
I was working in my room as a little boy, and I even took the new radio back to my mother, and the day she made me almost everything, but I learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a control plant from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn on the right or left. It's flashing.
And I turned a switch to get the lights off and turn the lights off.
This is a little halne from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar column is releasing the battery that provides electricity to the grid. I call it a transformer.
And the driver's safety is flashing.
You can see that the halps are going outwards, because they come from there, the lions come from there.
This is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are flashing and lions think I'm going to go around the floor. And I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and since then, we didn't have any problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lion lions in the background.
I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're actually doing pretty well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including for other predators like Hywunes or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention took me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helps by fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights in together where there's no one, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
A year ago, I was just a boy from the savanna who was eating his father's cows, and I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of them!"
And here I am.
I was allowed to create an airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and a pilot, that's my big dream.
I used to make lions. But through my invention, I can save the cows and kill the lions. We can do it together, side with the lions, without the arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you are.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
So my next invention, now, I work on an electric fence. An electrode fence?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, right -- yeah, I tried to do this, but I tried to give it back, because I got -- I got a blow.
So at the beginning, it's hard. Richard Turder, you're kind of special.
We're going to hire you at any step of your house, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in your hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you my 15 favorite pictures, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of executive, no style, no chance of shooting a picture, not even being considered the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot from random tourists.
My story starts when I was in New York, and my wife took this picture, where I put my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57 and 5th birthday.
So just a year later, we were back in New York, so we decided to shoot the same picture.
Well, you can see what's going on --
And when my daughter came up, my daughter said, "Hey, why do you want Sabina not to New York and do a father's daughter's daughter's motion to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're having a complete stranger's camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody's ever ever given to our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these trips would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a stumbling moment or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to keep the time in October and to change our time and how we are going to change the way we were year year, not just physically, but in everything, to reflect.
Because while we always make the same picture, our perspective is going to change time, as they reach more and more and more and more windows, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and how they see it.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect to expect every year.
So, on the other hand, as we walked, we walked out of the street, and suddenly we were stuck in the form of the red bar, and it shows a red bar on a dollboard that they had learned as a little kid, and I learned how to travel earlier.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old, at this point.
She said she remembered her heart from her chest when she first saw the store at the first time.
And now they look in New York to high schools because they really want to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we're all creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious part of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides these 15 pictures, I'm hardly in the very small photo of a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage all of you today to come up with the image and not ask someone to ask, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 25.26, 55.4/32.1/19.9/12.5 (BP=0.979, ration=0.980)
