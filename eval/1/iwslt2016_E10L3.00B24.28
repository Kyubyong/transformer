When I was 11 years old, I was a kid who was a little bit of fun when I was 11 years old.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was rather unusual at the time, because he was typically angry by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone."
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
That morning, I'm never going to forget that morning.
A real school.
The Taliban did the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I went to school for five years as a boy, and I left my older sister who had no longer been prepared for a secret school.
And we could go to school for both of them.
Every day, we took a different way, so nobody could guess where we were going.
We're just sitting in our blog shops so it looks like we're going to go out and buy.
We've been in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was a bit fun, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And all of a sudden, the class had to fall out for a week because the Taliban had dropped her breath.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and women were significant.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
On a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was distracted by his father.
My mother was a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women out of the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family ever received a education.
It was always clear for him that his children would get a training, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risk.
He looked at it as a much larger risk to send his children to school.
I know that in the years, I was frustrated by the Taliban, sometimes, of our lives, of the constant fear and the perspective of the complexity.
I had good fun to give up, but my father said, "Tin-daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be eliminated from your house.
But one thing is that you're going to remain, what's in there. And even if we need to pay our blood to your lunch fees, we're going to do that.
So, you still want to give me a question?"
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that had been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women, they have a higher degree than the Sekar degree, and when my family had not been used so much for my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I stand here today as a proudly proudly in the middle of the middle of the middle teacher College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was released from his family, because he proved to send his daughters to school, one of the first people that was advising me.
He's not just talking about my high school, but also for me, I was the first woman, and I'm the guy driving him through the car in Kabul.
My family thinks me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
That's why I'm global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start up with SOLA, the first one, and maybe the only internist for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school school teacher is still risky.
It's wonderful to see how students in my school want to experience great ambition for all of them to have their aspirations.
And to see how their parents and fathers are facing them, like me, even though my parents, despite all the contradictions,
Like Ahmed. This is not really his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and they're through a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes away.
When he got home, the phone rings up, and a voice would beat him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try it again.
And he said, "Well, if you want me to, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the game because of your old-fashioned and overlooked imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've discovered something that's often passed out in the West: behind most of us, the success, the success, the value of his daughter and the fact that it's successful is their success.
That's not to say our mothers don't play a role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are more likely to be understood and compelling about a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely unaware.
And the Taliban just went to school a few hundred girls, because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears from America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the change is not the length, and the way the U.S. population changes everything.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them for them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me, the hope and the unconcilable opportunities, and remember the girls going to the SOLA every day.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, including a profession -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1977, I look young, but not -- -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, Ivo, Algeria and Somalia projects with technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years, thought that we are a good person in Italy, and we were successful jobs in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we started to do.
Our first project, what was inspired by the first book called "Ripples in Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of the Sambias, how to grow food.
We got to the Italian seed in South Zambia, in this lovely valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We taught the local population to grow the traditional tomato and pmmini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came to the work.
And we were surprised to see that there was no such waste in the valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't make it, we just said, "Thank you for being here!"
"Maven't happen to save people's Sambias before the star star."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-social tomatoes. In Italy, they became so large, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, just as agriculture is."
When the tomato bubble was growing and red, about 200 ponds were coming out of the river and they were all about it.
We said to the Sambenns, "Oh God, the nourper!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great at the Mammett in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the English world did, after I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We used to feed the nourper.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we didn't have to have any of our African population.
They should read the book "Dead Aidid" by Damadisa Moyo, she's a Citiian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just follow your book.
Think about a African woman that we've done.
We are Western people, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we hypnotize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both of these words come from the Latin root, which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I myself myself myself on another culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I'm going to keep myself on another culture than they were my servant.
That's why white people are called "bondult, headw.
I became more excited when I read the book "Sautiful" of the singing, and he said, especially in the economic development, when people don't want help, they leave you alone.
That's the first principle of help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
And this morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocolata?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react only to people, and I invented a system called the company that never is being launched, never get a reward, but you become the local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you keep your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you sit together with the local community.
We don't work from office.
We meet in cafeteria. We meet in Kubipen.
We have no infrastructure.
We close to friendhood and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone a clue.
If that person doesn't like what you're doing?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own life is the most important thing for humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this failure: Why instead of going to a community and say to people what they should do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have part of them, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what they see.
So programming has a blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be in public meetings.
We're working on one to do that, we need to be made by social infrastructure that's not there.
A new job has to be created.
This is the home doctor of the company, the hospital of the business that you're sitting in the house with you in your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools, your passion to transform life.
I tried this in vitentance, West Australia.
I trained at the time, and I tried to get rid of the disbelief, where we say other people what to do.
And so, I went through the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, I helped him. I helped him find fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perth, and then he came to the fishermen, and they said, "You've helped us do Maor?"
I helped these five fish, together, and I didn't sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents aKilo, but for Japanese sushi for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them?"
In one year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk>"<unk> I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I hold my mouth and I listen to them."
So -- well, the government says, "Do you want it again."
We did it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the process of the world.
There's a new generation of companies that go beyond loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business managers of history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was philosophy professor before he was working with companies. Peter Cameron said, "Do programming is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So planning is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest human Christchurch is going to do with their money and their energy.
You need to learn how to get that to get you to one.
You have to offer them discontion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to be discrete.
In a community of 10,000 people, we're going to get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
For the talk, you've liked most of your hands today?
"Sear, passionate people." You applaud this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-spilling fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn machine is not sustainable.
The open-off of the state is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, we can create, transport, and address them with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Are universities? Do you forget it.
The government? Do you forget.
It will be entrepreneurs. And they do it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to talk to the future of the city in the 1860s of New York.
In 1860, they came together and they were speculated, which would happen in the city of New York, and the conclusion was a constant: The city of New York would not exist 100 years ago.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, when the population grew up at this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to do it, and it's impossible to get them done with the dung of six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race, and there were little little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered discontion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, dedicated and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of these things have to do, three things that are required to sell the product, the market market market, has to be great, and the financial accounting needs to be huge.
You guess what?
We never met a single person that could produce something that would be used at the same time, sell and care about the money.
That's not what it's like.
That person had never been born.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Winghouse, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, just one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 year-old entrepreneurs in Northland, and we start to teach them the students to give the first two pages of Richard Bransian Autographography, and the job of the 16-year-old is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransian Autographs, how often he uses the word "tus" and how often the word "twe."
Never "w," and 32 times, "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody founded.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small entrepreneur in cafeteria and Bars. They're dedicated buddy to what they're going to do for a guy who's done for this gentleman who's talking about this epist, someone who's going to tell you, "You know what?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to your money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate trusts to help them find the means of the means and people, and we found that the wonders of the local population, that the culture and the economy can be changed only by the passion, the power of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should have to be Alice in miracles in the country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communication -- to address the education of engineers.
I was scared.
Real fear. And so before these students, with their large brains and their large books and their large ones, they don't trust me.
But when the conversation evolved, it took me like Alice when she got down to the taper, and a door looked like a whole new world.
And I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed about the thoughts they had, and I wanted to find that other miracles that they found.
I think to open the door, it's great communication.
We need to really have great communication with our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environment and health, and when we don't know about it, and they don't understand it, they're not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religistic, to be able to look at these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers are not invited us to their miracles country.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please join us.
And I want to show you some of the ways that you can do this, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to is, okay?
Let's tell you why your scientific field is so relevant for us.
It's not just that our feathers study, but it also tells us that their feathers, the plastic structure in our bones, are studying them because it's important to understand and treat.
And when you describe what you do, then you're preventable-tist.
Now, the phrase "unve" is a obstacle to your mind.
And surely you could use your "pit and time" and "Why don't you just say "play and time," which is much more enjoyable for us?"
We're not going to turn our thoughts wrong, it's not the same as you're going to throw off your level.
As Einstein said earlier, "Make things as easy as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific field without having to compromise.
Some things are about this: examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can pull us into your booth.
And if you present your work, let's throw the dots away.
Have you ever asked why it's called a point?
What happens when someone comes to mind? Another one is just going to take a second, and with these dots, your audience.
Now, the slide like this is not boring, but it's too much about the conversation about the work-making part of our brain, and that's how we're really focused on it.
This example of Gene Bonveins Brown is much more effective. It shows that the particular structure of the feather is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, easy sentence that you can use, when it's a certain person, it's going to lose the thread, it's using images and graphics that are also creating our other senses, and it's going to create a deeper understanding of what it is.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up these doors and see the wonderland that are happening in science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been taught to make up with the <unk>Nat<unk> in me, I want to summarize anything with a equation.
Look at your science, your discourse, your writing, divide through the popularity, which is the audience, which is important, and multiply the whole with the passion you've had for your incredible work, and that is a completely unthinkable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I really hated myself.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the world of mankind in Syria.
You can start a message with a phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a song with a phone, upload it in the soundscoud and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
And you can see how hundreds of people went to the streets and show up the road.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all these people who are coming out and asking change, had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on this?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phone up, keep it up.
Hold it up. Android, Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost every single one of them today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and how my life has changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Pove raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, E.U. is a policy line.
The right line is called the U.S. base for the federal power.
The rule of this is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in Europe, has to store a range of users's information.
Who calls? Who calls you? Who calls an email?
Who is sending a text message?
And when you use a phone, where you're.
All of this information is stored at least six months, until two years of your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And everywhere in Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want to go."
They said, we don't want to use this trade supply.
We want to use self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet service to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people went to the streets of Berlin and say, "Fake fear instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be on the Stiver 2.0.
The Stiver State is the headcard attacki in eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering if this really works.
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my phone, I use my phone?
So I asked my phone company, the De-Phire, who was the biggest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send all the information you've stored me.
And I asked her once, and she asked her again, and he didn't get a right answer. Just a half-eaning blue.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's tracking it.
So I decided to put a court court on it, because I wanted to have that information.
But the <unk>Ph. telecommunications said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to go back to the bill that they're sending me all the information to.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of the E.U. issued the law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown back with a CD.
And on the CD, this is what it was.
358 lines of information.
First, I looked at it, and I said, well, it's a huge date. My drive.
But then I realized, after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, I sleep at night what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what the U.S. Security Council means.
So with time and open data in the city, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in, you can go ahead and go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt with the train to C<unk>l<unk>n, and how many calls I walk.
And all of this is possible by this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like, I call my wife and she calls me to me, and we're going to talk a couple times.
And then a few friends call me up, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see anything.
You can see the central figures, like who the leader of the group is.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who you're talking to who you're sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we've been imagining that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi had known who was at the demonstration, and when the dines knew who the leader had been, that would be, maybe it's never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall might have not happened.
And then, of course, the case of the iron curtain.
Because the state agency today and companies want to store so many information as they can get over us, online and online.
They want to be able to track our lives, and they want to store all of that in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you'll tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your representative, just because companies and state states have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information you've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight the self-interest in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central, the curbs, the rapid restaurants, the Braille spaces.
So the city plan is coming in, and they changed the name of South Central, so that it's about something else, it's changing it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
The mundane carpenter, rapid restaurants, Braille spaces.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivetbys and the Drivebysys.
The comal is that the Drivehrus is killing more people than the urge man.
People die in South Central Los Angeles about sacred diseases.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really get that over.
And I wondered how you would feel if you had no access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I've been able to buy the rollmill and sell as a use of transport.
I see dialogue centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it's got to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like a minute-old kid to get an apple that's not under-performing pesticides.
So I planted a food hot in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the parking lot.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care about it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, L.A. Green Grass, and we started to plant my food and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of professional group, we're combined by the gardeners of all social layers and from the entire city, and it's completely voluntary, and everything we do, it's free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else complained.
The city came to me, and he basically gave me a propulsion, and said that I had to get rid of my garden, the supply was a rifle to a rifle.
And I thought, "Well, come on, do you?
A verbal set of reporters for food in a piece of land that you don't care about?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her name with it."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The LAA. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about the city park, and with a member of Green Ground Ground, they calculated a petition on Change.org and 1,600 regulations.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My town even called up, and said that they support and love what we do.
So, really, why don't they do that?
LA.A. has the most treasures in the United States, the largest spaces in the possession of the city.
They own 67 miles in Braille spaces.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato sauce plants.
Why the devil shouldn't you find that well?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my co-touch, I say people should grow their own food.
to build its own food as it's to print its own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central Central Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I tend to be part of this preconial reality that was made by other people, and I plant my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
So gardenwork is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls are filled, I'm going to fill lawns and air spaces.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my use for this stuff.
You might be surprised by what the Earth's soil can do when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
You might wonder how children are affected by this.
And I'm a brest and the most bold act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you can get strawberries.
I remember when this mother came to her and her daughter, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my backyard, and I got out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason for the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just empowered me to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum devil, no, I'm not afraid they're going to be missing.
And that's what it's about in the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take care of their health."
On another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in D inner L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to download the vaster.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was a great thing to see how it changed, even for a moment.
Green Grounds have planted about 20 gardens.
We went to our farms and we got 50 people and we did it, and they're all volunteers.
When children grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they're not offered anything, if they're not shown, how food and body affect, they're blinding, whatever you're talking about.
I see young people who want to work, but they put in this thing -- I see color kids that are just on the path that they're about to be in the process, and they're not going to go anywhere.
The gardeners, I see as a chance to train these children to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And when we do that, who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood block in gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipboard and turn it into healthy cafeteria.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-feeding, because free is not sustainable.
The cometing of sustainability is that you have to keep them through.
I'm talking about giving people work, and I'm going to bring kids out of the streets, and to get them to enjoy the pride and the honor of getting them when you build your own food, and when you open the farmers.
So, what I want to do here is to do sexy here.
I want to be the green rebel, the gang, the gangmen, the carpenter.
We need to turn the image of the gang star.
If you're not a carpenter, you're not a gang.
You're going to have to go with a carpenter, right?
And let's just take that to your choice.
If you want to meet me with me, don't call me up if you want to sit in the stupid chairs and make a meeting where you talk about it, some kind of kisses.
If you want to meet me, you come to your shuffle, in my backyard, so that we can plant some check.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "nnollygary."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "nnantidary" means "n'ton-free politicians."
In the 19th century, when a newspaper editors passed a better definition, "A Snollygamer is someone who stands in a state of office, independent party or program or postfunding, and his success of the pure propensative statisticality."
I have no idea what a "coiceal" is.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
Twenty-five-five1, for example, British Parliament were invited to publish newspapers, not the exact word of debating the debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with this extraordinary name called Brassrosby, who had been with Parliament.
They threw it to the Tower of London and they got upset, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to go to the Dutch, and eventually he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so" as well as Brassif."
Brus's about the English word for a ride.
But that's not true. It's going back to a failure of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are interacted, I want to take you in the United States, at the time when it's just your independence.
You're looking at the question of how to call George Washington, the state, the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader a sovereign nation?
It's been debated in Congress for a long time.
And there were all kinds of extrapolators there.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his senior George Washington, and again, the defenses of the people in the United States of America.
Not so much as you can.
Some people just wanted to call him a king.
They thought it's already available.
They weren't monarchistic, they wanted to vote the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored, because this debate had three weeks of training.
I read the days of a Senate that's always going on, "I've kept the same issue."
The reason for the delay, the long-termity was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want to make the Washington Dgier. They didn't want to.
The king, and maybe it's a question for ideas that he's going to do.
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most mouriest title, the most ecnondrous title they could think of.
This title was "Pisember."
President. They didn't invent the title. It only meant that someone was being run off a meeting.
It's something like the end of a jury.
He had no longer the size as the term "Dearing" or "Dear water."
Sometimes, there were little colonial teams and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
And so the Senate refused to stop him.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up the agreement and meet foreign-wots.
Who's going to take it seriously when he's got a stupid little title like President of America's United States?"
And then after three weeks, the Senate did not stop.
Instead, you've been told to use the title of "Beautical," but they absolutely wanted to understand that they were not accountable for the beliefs of their own and the institutions, whether it's in the Republic, whether it's the state of the state, that the state of the state of the state, not necessarily unfinished -- not the end of the state, the end of the future, the world's end of the world's self-to-stem
You can learn three interesting things.
One, and I think that's best -- until now, I can't figure out if the Senate has ever been officially expressed the name of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just celebrated the title. He just wait for the Senate to be active.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- -- you'll wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is that the most important point is, "The title of the United States today" is not so humbling, right?
It's something that has to do with more than 5,000 nuclear wasteheads that he has, and the largest economy of the world and a river drone and all that stuff.
and reality, the title of the story has given the size.
And that's how the Senate ended up.
They have a respectable title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the head of self-destructive -- well, it was.
But do you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear explosives and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, the representative house lost, because no one feels humble when you're told you're the president of America's United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take to you, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but actually change the reality much more than the words of reality could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a chair with about 50 reporters fighting to the Cralalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would go to my black Conventical gloves against a pair of brown leatheres and a rocket in a direction of the government frer that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And I had recently been a big time before the war, but besides the Pyjama party, playing football and playing at Samsenies and guiding the racist-state groups and the inter-religious protesters living with no communism and art and Afghanistan, and the way before I knew what I knew.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I stand here, I think, "Bitizen, South America" in Godbuol, an atheist and a radically political artist who lived last nine years in Afghanistan and created.
So, there's a lot of great things in Afghanistan about the art that you could do, but I personally don't like to paint rainworms. I want art that makes the personality and trust and the work-makers and the reality and the reality, and the kind of creative people, to try and try to understand the world that we live.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- "Gol, who governs jihad against communists like <unk>Phopie Bling" and use abusive religious and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be done to the jihad meeting for Parliament and to make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Take me! I'm going to do jihad.
And try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosiosi that are spending as a national hero.
I want to go to the reason that I'm going to go to Afghanistan, with a project called "Rearing," where you're going to be a policeman, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes and money from them, they give money to the name of the police in Kabul, and they hope that they're 100 percent of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become for the Cropian conflict.
The war and the strange view of it came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion training for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was able to train the garden of local Afghan dressers with a more protection or some sort of a recreational, a neochial, a self-picial work.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan of Kabul looks like the work of 189999 to create a dialogue about how today's development-based representatives have been in the last-down rhetoric about the gay man, to protect the brown man, to be able to defend themselves, to be a little bit of a civil society, and maybe a little bit of a civilized civilization.
But for all of these things, you can go to prison, they can be misunderstood, misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of self, it needs.
That's my burden. What's your one?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I've been working as a model for a while.
I've been talking about 10 years ago.
I feel like this is a very unconventable tension in the room, because I should have been attracted to this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit more change on this.
This is the first time that someone is walking into the TED stage, so you can appreciate yourself happy to see that.
If a few women were really excited when I came out, you don't need to tell me this now, I'll read it on Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm quite privileged, because I can change in a very short, 10 seconds, what you think about me.
And that's not the chance that everybody has the opportunity to do that.
These are the disconnections that are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the sweater over my head, because you're going to keep me all off, so you're not doing anything until it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as uncomfortable as this picture.
It's a very powerful image, but it's also super-linear.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should put my back oil and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong clones that I've been covering two days ago for work, there are very few ways of changing our disconnection, and our utteration -- although it's super-trusive and irreducible -- a big impact on our lives.
Fearless to be honest for me is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you do a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy, and maybe you wonder what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have no tendency to define beauty as healthy and primitive and symmetrical, to be trained to be biological, but also as big, feminine, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this, and maybe some kind of fashion providers are like, "Haltomi, Tyra, Tyra. Joan Sman's.
And first, I'm going to comment on your model, you know. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, the Stanford Medical Center has been counted all the modules on the run, each one of them, the more likely to be trained, and that 677 units were not only at all.
The next question that I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can do anything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which is completely wrong, because you're the first one."
When they say, after this great, I'm still saying, "No, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "I'm going to be my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the head editor of American birdry or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meelel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like you'd say you want to win the Jacket in the lottery.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career way.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of a recent model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be seen.
If there's a photographer and the light is right there, like a nice radiation, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a picture in the run," then the leg goes on first and long, and then, back to the back of that arm, the arm is on the back of the head, and you move back to the wheel, and you just go back, and you just see, 300 times, 400 times, 400 years ago, you see, 400 friends
It looks like this.
I hope that it's less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and have a life cycle, and a few jobs have done, unfortunately you can't say much more than saying that when you want to be President of the United States, but in the lifetime, "10,000 underwear," you'll be curious.
The next question that I've been asked for is, "Who are you going to bring all the photos?"
And yes, so much of the photos are retured, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first picture I did, and that was the very first time I had a bikini. I didn't even have that period.
I know this is going to be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
And so I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this song.
My friend had to come with me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a launch for French birdry.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not images of me.
They are constructative, and they are a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and Stylists and all of their assistants and the FDA and the treatment. That's not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Do you have things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-pound gloves that I can never wear, except just the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a shop and had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I drove to my friend with a terrible driver, and they were tracking a red light, and of course, we were stopped. It only took a "Fear, Mr. Words," and we were able to go on.
I paid this costless stuff for my appearance, not because of my personality, and there are people who pay for their appearance and not for their personality.
I live in New York and from 140 teenagers who have been stopped and captured last year, 85 percent of black and Latinos and young men.
It's only 177 young, male and Latino, who don't ask the question, "Am I stopping?"
But, "How often am I going to stop? When I stopped?"
In my research, I found out that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number goes up to 78 percent when they got 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little bit thin, and you have a darker hair, then you feel very happy and excited."
And we'll give back courses a response that might give you a sense of this.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
Everything is true, but it's just half the story, because we never say before the camera, which I never said before the camera, is, "I feel confident."
And I feel insecure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask me, "Would I be happier if I had thin legs and darker hair?"
And then you should meet some models, because they have the thin legs, the most beautiful hair and the coolest hair, and they're the same for their appearance, probably the most insecure women on the planet.
When I prepared this talk, it seemed really difficult to me to move a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to go here and say, "I got all the benefits out of a stack that's been brought into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good to say, "Well, I don't always feel happy."
It was very difficult to share a legacy of oppression and race when I was one of the biggest uses of it.
But I'm happy and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great to have done this here before 10 or 30 years, or 30 years, and my career is still unfinished, because I wouldn't think I would probably tell my job, or I would have been told my job, I would not tell you how I paid college.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our own failures and failure more often.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who had come to life in exile, "Son, Gaddafi, Resistance.
But I'm never going to be a guy like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's now two years since the military revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass-polding and in the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I connected with many other neanans, in and outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyranny Gadadian regime.
And there it was, a big revolution.
Boy, grand-grandver women and men stood in the first row, the end of the regime, kept the end of the regime, kept the rules of freedom, dignity, social justice.
They've demonstrated the most compelling courage by putting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafah.
They showed a strong sense of solidarity, from far east to the far east, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, it made us free our country and the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a large burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for the course of the course.
Over four decades, Gaddafah's tyrannical regime has destroyed both infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the ly-neish society.
The devastation and the challenges, I used to call as many other women who are building civil vyas in Australia, and we demanded a willingness to lead to democracy and nationalization.
Near 200 organizations, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis, in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exil, I returned to Lybia, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops for the issues of learning, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform of Mayymen, a movement of women, leaders of different life forms, whose goal is to engage in public leadership, to embrace women's socirative and to our right-being in politics.
In the case of the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led a campaign to the peacebuilding platform for women to achieve a passive choice, a law that every citizen, no matter what the background should be, and to vote, and to, especially to a political negotiation between a male and female-makers, to a vertical-level level, and to make a difference to a constant.
At the end, we've been taken off and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the national government in the first elections since 52 years.
But long, the euphority of the elections and the whole revolution, because every day we started to get into new messages about violence.
And one morning we entered the news about the treasure of ancient mosques and the Sufi leaders.
In another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
After a different morning, the suicide bombers were signed by the armed forces.
And in fact, we are at the governing of the military and their ongoing causes against human perpetrators and their misdiagnairments of laws and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mental state, polarized, distant from the ideals and principles, dignity, social justice, which they had initially begun.
Intent, rejection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success of our failed and elections.
In fact, I'm here today to say that we've made a nation that's wrong choices and the wrong choices.
We've answered our priorities wrong.
Because the elections did not bring peace or security in Lybia.
Did the hard-tuning and the shift between female and male leaders have been fighting peace and national reconciliation?
No, it didn't.
What is it?
Why is our society going to continue to polarize and dominate the selfish politics of dominance and the end of men as well as women?
Perhaps the women were not the only thing to miss, but the female values of compassion, the Gade and the end.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a continual shift when it took the elections, which ultimately strengthening the polarization and fragmentation.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female as it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop doing the name of the anger and demanding a day of the revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gade.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only does the values, but also to say, "Bade Thurs, instead of cooperation, instead of lacking a lack of competition, instead of not a lack of discourse.
These are the ideals that need a war of rapty lasia desperately to get peace.
Because peace has an alchemie and in this alchemie, it's about the cross-cading of feminine and masks.
That's the real thing.
And we need to do that in general before we do sociology.
After a stop from the Koran, "Salamam" -- "is the word of the Good God, slugy."
The word "raveem" again, which is known in all the latehamian traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "lon <unk>in <unk> <unk>"<unk>" and symbolizes the female feminine, all of humanity, the man's men and the female female, all the peoples.
And just like the mother, the embryo, which grows in it, is so much as the basic defending of compassion is the existence of life.
And so we were told, "My Godllie gives all things."
And so we were told, "My Gade's got my way before my TEDx."
And let's all be the arys of the Gade.
Thank you.
When I was a little kid, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In the school, we started to look at the story of Kim Il's story, but we didn't learn much about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was often wondering how the outside world is, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea until all of a sudden changing.
When I was seven years old, I saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to never suffer from hunger myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with my sister's sister.
And it said, "If you were here, our five family members are not going to be in this world because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about it for the first time that people were laughing in my country.
Shortly, I went through the train station and saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A squad, a woman stood on the ground, and a fixed child in her arm looked helplessly in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'99s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans liked to sacrifice, and many others survived because they ate grass, beetles and celars.
In the wake of the traffic, more and more and more and more and more, in the night, it's all about me, except the lights of China on the other side of the web that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the Chistine, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very profound and enabled North Koreans to escape.
Many die.
Sometimes I saw the bodies moving into the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that as I was sent to the devastating years of famine to the relatives of China.
I just thought I was separated by my family for a short time.
I'd never thought it would take 14 years to work together.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be like the North Korean refugee. But soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was seen when I was caught up by the Chinese police and sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be North Koreans, so they tested my Chinese assumptions and gave me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
If I had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a divorce, I could be locked up and we're being rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions, and I would answer the questions.
After they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "This was a false failure.
She's not North Koreans."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
In fact, some North Koreans in China are getting messages likeyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls had great luck.
Even though they've been caught, they were finally released by tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans did not have so much luck.
Every year, 150,000 North Koreans are caught in China, and they're already released to North Korea, where they're tortured, imprisoned, or publicly re-pilled.
Although I had been able to escape happiness, many other North Koreans don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
And after they learn a new language and work, their world can be put in a moment on their head.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I went to South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
I also realized the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we're very divergent, because of 67 years,
I went through a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstore?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that my home could have been.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't slow, I had a plan.
I prepared for the recording test at the University of the university.
Just as I became a little more normal in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean government began to release the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family forced to hang out to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to go back to a tremendous route to the freedom of the road.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China and made me go to the south-west border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them through more than 2,000 miles of China and then go to South Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we got nearly several times caught.
Once, when the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the mix of all of them, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were being arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I decided to be a dog, and he said that she was a child, and I was a senior person.
He looked at me really stupid, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to go to the Portuguic border, but I had to go out almost all my money to try to make the border-making of Laos's borders.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border-range borders.
After I paid money and a bakery, my family had been released within a month, but for a moment, my family was replicated back, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest blessings of my life.
I had done everything to defend my family to freedom, and we were so close to this, but my family was arrested, just before the South South Pole.
I went to the conclusion between the immigrant and the police department, trying to free my family, but I had not enough money to pay for the cash or money to pay.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a foreign person is about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and he went to a bank mechanic, and they paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about the whole heart of my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to hire the northeast Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The earlier foreignists defined me a new hope that the North Koreans needed to be so much, and he showed me the friend of strangers and support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I've come back to South Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they come into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, the English, the professional education, and a lot more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family support, and we're sending them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to be able to revive the hope of Northern Koreans, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide it, and he's going to give it a little bit of a little bit of trouble.
It's not stupid. He's not looking at the color color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to describe words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of a thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It's absolutely meaningless memory.
But it's also a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate fries, but he reminds up of every song on my iPod, talking about when we were four times the first result of the teoon on my arm to put on my arm and Lady Gagagag.
Don't listen to it?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the social version of normal, they often have been understood and wrong.
But what motivated my heart and my soul was that, although it was the case that they weren't similar to the same as usual, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic, extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compassionism," it's a complex function of the brain that's influenced social communication, learning and physical abilities.
It's actually a different part of every individual, so Remi is so different than Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, it's been discovered in a new person that's autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been through autism, but I can't remember myself without even remembering it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He was a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a time.
He didn't want to play the same baby, and in fact he didn't seem to be very interested in me.
Remi lived in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a row, putting the washing machine and eating everything that was coming in.
And when he got older, he became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the Frilust, and the never end of hyperactivity, something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being never had.
Exceptional.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were as me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normalality is about the beauty that give us the differences, and the fact that we're different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and Sam to you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift, each of us has a gift, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance for scale, progress and change dies at the moment where we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edveron has filled with awe and curiosity with this photograph on a project that's been collected by a apple and with a mass destruction period of only a millionth.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtoemto photography, a new engineering technology that's so fast that it can create slow-time-speed images of light.
And so we can build cameras that are going to look at the outside of our view, or if you can see an <unk>-ray image in our bodies and really ask what we're doing with the MMM.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and take it in a billionth of a second -- these are several second-by-by-secondsixs -- I create a package of photons that's hardly a scale, and this photodot-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-through this project
So, if you take this project, this photons pack, and you shoot it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event.
So, think about this, the whole event is actually taking less than a nanotope -- so long as long as we can go back the route -- but I'm going to try to slow this video to get the factor 10 billion to see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this film, a lot of things happens, so let me analyze it, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon pack, starting to move through, and eventually break into the inside.
And part of the light comes out of the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Most of the photons are ultimately reaching the bottle and explode into different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's going around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflex from the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images at the end.
Now, if you take a more common project and let it go back and take the same route back, and you can slow the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what does it look like with a still life photographer?
You can see again, like the waves of the table, the Tomate and the wall in the background.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature would paint this picture, each of them, a Femto image, but of course our eye looks a collection of a collection.
But if you look at these Tomats, you'll see that when the light hits the Tom's lights, it's going to be completely different. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because Tom is coming in and jumps around and forth in a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this FemtoMouse is built in your Cameroon, it might be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if an fruit is a closed, without touching it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you do a picture of a short-term amount of air, you have very little light, but we're going to be able to make a billion times faster than your short-term quality time, so you're going to get a little bit of light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons package, and we're drawing it, you know, multi-million-fold, and we're going to do this with very clever synchronization and we're combining this gigabytes of data to create these milemto-to-s video videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superhero: Can we see corners?
The idea is that we're going to turn some light on the door.
It's going to be disintegrated, in the space, a part of it will reflect back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use this more nuanced interrupted, multi-fold-scale material.
And this is not science fiction. We've even made it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden in the face, and we're going to leave the light off the door.
After our paper was published in theNature Communications, it was made by Nature.com, and they created these animation.
We're going to chop up this light project, and we're going to put these light-by-side corridors, and these photons are all in the direction, and some of the photons are going to reach our hidden soup that will allow us to break the light, and then a little bit of the lights of the window, and then a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but they'll be very interesting at the time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It's got a very good time-solving, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, because of that, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of the distance is.
By turning a laser, we can record a raw image, which, as you see on the screen -- not really makes sense, but when we take many of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-through the room, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We've done a little bit more than we can do before we can implement the lab into the practice, we could build cars that avoid collisions, and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous treasors, by looking at light, by looking at the window, or we can build the end of the window, we can build the end of the wall, the inside the body, the Neotop, the Nellot, and also the tux
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is a very challenging thing, which is really a call for scientists, now, to think about Ftoto-M photographer, because a new visual process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging.
So, like Docton, even a scientist, is a art of the ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data we're collecting every time, not just a scientific picture, but we can also create a new form of computer photon, a memory, a memory, and a memory, and we can see that time, and the speed of time, and the speed of time, and the light, and we can see that time.
But it happens to be a little bit more fun here.
If you look at the waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're going to take almost in the speed of light, weird effects, Einstein and Einstein would have seen this picture incredible.
The order of what happens in the world is going to be repeated in the camera, so by using the underlying relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So, don't care whether it's to travel around photography or to create a new visual framework for medicine or new approaches, since we've been able to open all of our data and hope that the owners are the ones that are the ones that are creative and the ones that are going to allow us to stop to step out to the megacities, the two-dimensional, the next step-dimensional, the next step-to-step, the next step, the next step,
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our people can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many teachers are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and scars and crosses.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent are you paying my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying to each other?
How can we divide our memories of the buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we divide our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is chelled out of the vast euths, the last few years, the craving and the shade, the shade, the shade, I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the rest of our lives in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how I can confuse it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death came all and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it brought me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in in now in life.
But I'm hard to keep this view of the day.
It's easy to lose your daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the house into a huge board, and I wrote with a bridge in the gaps, "I want to die, I want everybody, come back, take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with this experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it grew and it was growing.
I want to share some sentences with you, written by the people in the wall.
"I want to die, I want to be suited for piracy."
"I want to die, I want to stand across the International Trip line."
"I want to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I want to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die, I want to live in a sub-control."
"I want to die, I want to keep them in my arms once."
"I want to die, I want to be a guy's art series."
"I want to die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes of the people, and the dreams of the people brought me to laugh, to the wine, and to the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's a new and urgent way of understanding.
It's about creating space for us and thinking about it, remembering what's most important, as we grow and changing.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a constructionbox, and now in countries like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Spain and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have when we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices with more and more people.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships for other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right view and thinking about it, that life is short and sensitive.
We're often discouraging about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The idea of death makes us feel life.
Our shared spaces show us the best, what is important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, can only help us to create better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, I'm involved in effective mathematics, a special problem for everyone who's been engaged in the practice of effective math, that we're like business managers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so today I'm going to try to explain what I do.
And dancing is one of the most human activity.
We are excited about the image of the Danish Ballett and the teats that you're going to see.
The ballett is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and possibly a fundamental repositation that a genetic component could have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability, which is what it does for me to know about the writers of Janpult that was in the time of a balletomy.
Over the years, we've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet, in the world, 6.3 million people suffering from this disease, and they have to live with the irreducible symptom like weaknesses, cony, scarcity, and other things that cause that disease, and so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there's cure, if we have a objective measure that question.
Now, trouble is that there's no cognitive activation and other mechanisms of Parkinson's disease, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing that you can do is this 20-minute test tester.
You have to do it in the clinic. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies will never be done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a prereging tour to the hospital. What if patients could do this test yourself?
It wouldn't take a lot of expensive hospital workers.
It costs 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurologic unit.
And so I want to propose to you that I'm going to propose an unconventical way of trying to achieve that, because we're all, at least, virtual, virtual nares like my name of Jan Strips.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal lobe.
This is what happens in the normal state, when someone's writing a voice, we can look at the common ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make the sounds, and we all have the genes for it, FoxP.
And like ballet, it takes a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it comes to it.
And by the way, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocality, and the way the limbs are affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom, you can see an example of irregular vocal evidence.
We see the same symptoms.
Bad-sense, weakness, castical.
The language is even more and more aged and carning, and that's an example of it.
And this impacts on the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and the underlying effects of data, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, so we can now find where someone's in a votot between disease and health, just because of the vocal.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not the non-invasive. The test is given to the neurologists.
Not too little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for this.
And both of them are exactly the same. And they're not done by experts.
So they can be done in their own way.
They're very quick, they're at the bottom of 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a large amount.
And this amazing goals we can do now.
We can reduce logically in patients's difficulty.
Patients don't have to do routine interfaces in the hospital.
We can get objective data from shared observation.
We can do cheap mass support for clinical studies, and we can do the first study of the entire population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Now, we're going to start in this direction, we're starting to start the Parkinson's disease-making.
With Aculab and patient-based, we want to take a very large number of voices around the world to have enough initial data to allow for the potential of these goals.
We have a call-batage that's available to the three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who's using no Parkinson's, can call cheaply for a few cents, and I'll be known to be known to be gratefully, we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to be told during the call, whether this person has suffered from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them won't be able to finish it.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. Those conditions are important, because we're wired to say, to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is on the right time?
It's much better.
My students, Thanasis -- I have to give him a little bit of money, because he's done so amazing work -- now, it's working on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
This is what I call a improvement.
That means that people can call the phone and send the test to the phone, and people could call the test with Parkinson's disease, send their voice to the fact that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Luke, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the south, in a sense, in the middle, which means that wildlife animals like zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night, and I woke up in the morning, and she found dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the Massai, believes that we came together with our animals and the wildlife of the sky, so our animals mean so much.
I learned lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our ancestors. They are also led to this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's just as few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, there's a boy between six and nine years of his father's father, and that's what it was like to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but to help the lions see cows better.
But I didn't go. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I'd go next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the bird, and they go back. And the next time, they come, and they come, and they say, this thing doesn't move, that's still there.
and they take the base and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the Stall. I walked around with a torwer, and this time the lions didn't catch up.
Shows fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
I worked in my room as a little boy, and once again, the new radio of my mother, and the day, she taught me almost about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a driver of a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn your right or left. It's blinking.
And I turned a switch to turn the lights and turn the lights.
This is a little muffet from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar column puts the battery, the battery, provides electricity to the server. I call it a transientator.
And the driver's right is flashing.
You can see that the halches are going out, because they come from there,
This is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are flashing, and the lions believe I'm going to go around the rack, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and since then, we had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped from it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yeah."
I installed the lights. They can see the lions in the background.
I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really doing well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, for other predators like hymen or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from sea farms.
My invention took me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged, and it helps by donations and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights in the world where there's no one, and I'm showing the people how to use them.
One year ago, I was just a boy from the savanna who was eating his father's cows, and I looked at planes over me and said, "Eormoreorrow, I'm going to sit in one!"
And this is me.
I was allowed to create a plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and a pilot, that's my great dream.
I used to be singing. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions, we can live in common with the lions, with no argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, " Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you're listening.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing to the list?
So my next invention, well, I work on an electrical fence. An electrode puzzle?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- Yeah, I tried this before, but I've given the attempt back because I got a blow.
So, initially, Richard Turder, you're kind of special.
We're going to hire you every step of your dinner, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in your hand, photography is my passion, but today I'd share with you my 15 favorite pictures, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of leader, no style, no chance of shoot a picture. Not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by a surprisingly recent tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife took this picture, where I gave my daughter to my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57 and 5s.
So just a year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same picture once.
Well, you can see what's going on here ...
When my daughter came to my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why do you go to Sabina in New York and do a father's first-granddad to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking tourists to do a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture, when you get a complete stranger, it's going to be enough to have your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one's ever been left with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just a couple of weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a constant moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to keep the time in October, and to change our time, and how we change year year year, not just physically, but in everything.
Although we do the same image, our perspective of time is changing as they reach new new corridors, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and how they see it.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value, and we expect every year.
More recently, as we walked out of our trips, we walked out, and suddenly they were like, they show a red tag on a dolls, where they learned as a little kid, when they were in the previous day.
And she told me about their feelings that she thought was five years old on this particular place.
She said that she looked at her heart of her chest when she saw the store for the first time nine years ago.
And now they look in New York to high school schools because they really want to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we're creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the conscious way of memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not very close to a family photograph.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image, and please not ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 24.28, 55.4/31.7/19.5/12.1 (BP=0.957, ration=0.958)
