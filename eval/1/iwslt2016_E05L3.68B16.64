When I was 11 years old, I was a night of the sounds of the sound of the night.
My father heard on his little, white radio show on the BBC.
He saw a very happy story, which was a pretty unusual thing, because he was the news of the news.
He said, "The Taliban's gone."
I didn't know what that meant, but it made me very, very happy.
You can go to a real school." He said, "I'm going to say.
This morning, I'm never going to forget.
A real school.
The Taliban's power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and they were not fighting girls to go to school.
So I was so upsetting five years after a boy and my older sister who didn't have to go to jail at a secret school.
And we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so nobody could guess where we were.
We've got our books in a bag, so it looks like we're going to go to the street.
We were in a house, about 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was kind of unpaid, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were at our life, teachers, students, our parents and our parents.
And then after all, the class had to be cut out for a week, because the Taliban had been blinded.
We've never been sure how much they knew.
Are you going to succeed?
Did you know where we live?
We had scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a great fortune to grow up a family, in education, and daughters were more important.
My grandfather was far more likely to get away.
A cross-up of a remote state of Afghanistan, and he was able to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was taken out of his father.
My mother was a teacher, but he was a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to make our house in school and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- you can see here -- the first one in his family, ever received a education.
It was always clear that his children would have been a training, despite his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw a much higher risk to send his children to school.
I know exactly that in the past years, I was so frustrated by the Taliban's birthday, and I was so frustrated by our life, the fear of the instability and the subject.
I had a good job to give him a little bit of advice. But my father said, "Told daughter, I'm going to listen to you. You can lose your life.
You can't get your money. You can get out of the war.
But one thing you're going to do is that what's in there. And even when we're going to pay to our blood, we're going to have to be paid to the lunch.
So -- you're going to have to give you a question?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my wife's age, when I was a higher minister, and when my family had not been so strong for my education, I would have been able to do this for women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a cruel activist at the American School.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was beaten from his family, because he was given his daughters to school, who were the first one who was my favorite.
He's not just at my graduate school, but I was the first woman, and she was the first woman who's driving him to the car.
My family thinks about me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global activist for 100, a global campaign for education.
So I've been able to build MALA, which is the first public service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school is still less likely to girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in school have been able to make a great fortune to make all the potential.
And to see how their parents and fathers are, as they were, as my parents, despite me, and despite all the causes of the rest.
So, as Cuba, that's not really the name, and I can't show his face, but Cuba is the father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter was a daughter and he was on the home of Long Long in her village, and she's the death of the street to just escape for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone would send a voice and a voice, if he would go to school, she would try it again.
He said, "I'm going to kill me now, but I'm not going to put the future on my daughter because of your old-great-old ideas."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that's often happening in the West, the most of us have, is a father who understands his daughter's value and the value of his daughter is success.
It's not to be called our mothers's role in success.
They're often often, they're looking at the search and they're looking at a very compelling future of their daughters, but in a society, in Afghanistan, the support of men who are responsible for the rest of the world.
The Taliban left only a few hundred girls in school -- it was illegal.
Today, Afghanistan is about three million girls in Afghanistan's bank.
Afghanistan is looking at America, so it looks different.
The Americans recognize how safe these changes are.
I'm afraid that change is not the progress of the past and over-of-the-the-the-Sander communities change everything.
But when I see the students in Afghanistan, when I see the students in school, and their parents who are trying to use them, then I see a promise of the future and a past.
Afghanistan was one country for me, and the most profound possibilities, and I remember the day, the week, the New Yorker.
I've always been doing great dreams.
Thank you.
I do everything I do -- I was born from seven years ago in Africa as a young man.
In 1977, I see it from 1977, but I'm not -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Kenya, Malawi, Somalia and Somalia, in the technical projects of Africa.
I worked on an Italian company, and every single project that we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years ago, we thought that Italy is good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which was my first book called "Rrere" in Z<unk>nis<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>s<unk>, was a guy that we wanted to show in Italy's Italian people who are being built up in the S<unk>ampaahasasia,
We came to Italian autonomous seeds in Southwest, and we got this to the Sistine Chapel, which is what we've been teaching to the local communities of Italian and French tomato sauce.
Of course, the chief had no interest, so we were able to do it for the work, and sometimes they were still in the work.
We were amazed that there was no waste in the way that agriculture was.
Instead of asking why they don't make it, we said, "Thank God, that's where we're here."
"Tight time, people who are saving the S<unk>aeda."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this amazing tomato sauce. In Italy, they were so large, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Look, just as agriculture."
When the tomato and red, the black and red came out about 200 feet from the river and everything.
We said to the Sabbale, "Oh God, the pier!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that? You didn't have asked us."
I thought we were Italian, we were so great in Africa, but I saw what Americans did, what the French did. When I saw what was doing, what was done, what I was doing, I was pretty proud to do.
We were actually putting the pestine.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the wrongness that we don't have to have to have to have the limits of African-Americans.
You should read the book "Cad" from Tazo Moo, Mooo, she's a national scientist.
The book was published in 1999.
We've given the African continent to a trillion trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been.
Think about her book.
You're reading from a African, which is what we've done.
We're Western people, the informal, the colonial, the mission, and there are only two species that we deal with people, and we're talking about it. We're them, we're the patriocist.
Both words are from Latin root root, which means "cood" means "cood."
But they have two different meanings.
Unconistist: I'm going to make another culture, as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patolisis: I'm going to make another culture as if they were my boss.
This is why white people in Africa are called "lood", the boss.
I was blindly blind when I read the book "Tat"'s "Tood"" on the economic development, and he said, especially in the economic sector, if people don't want to go back.
This is the first principle of help.
The first principle of help are respect.
This conference, who was doing this conference, a bist, and she asked me, "Can you imagine a city that isn't the bioscopic?"
When I was 19, I decided to respond to people, I decided to respond to people, a system called a company that never gets done, but you're going to be able to get a guy who is responsible for local local local local talent, local people who have the local dream of the local community.
You do -- you're going to get your mouth.
You've never done a community with ideas, you're going to get together with the local community.
We're not working on offices.
We're going to make a place in cafeteria. We're going to make them in a p.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to close to friend and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone a idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for its own growth is the most important.
The passion for its own survival is the most important human.
We're helping them to find knowledge, because nobody can't succeed.
The person who has no idea, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one: Why not to come to a community and to say, why should we hear them? Not in the community?
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community-based collections.
You've never had entrepreneurs, and they're never going to say what they want to do with their money, what they see for the opportunities.
You have a search of action.
The most people in the community don't know because they never seem to be able to get to public public public public meetings.
We've got to work on one thing to do, a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the house of the company who is the Brazilian hospital who is working with you in your house and in the supermarket, and you can find the tools that are helping you to change your passion in a way that makes your life a life.
I tried this in action, West Street, trying to work.
I was trying to get a lot of time and trying to make the unaware of the dangers where we say what to do.
And so I went through the streets just in the first three days, and I had my first job. I brought it into a garage, he was in a garage, and he was in a restaurant, and he was able to sell him to a restaurant, and she said, "We'd come to a restaurant and then they'd help me build the M.S.
I helped them work on this five fish, and this wonderful tuna in California is not selling it to 35 cents per month, but for Japan, and they said to be in the farmer, "Hey, you've been able to help us help?"
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
I feel the mouth and I hear them."
So -- so the government says, "Look, look at it again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've been working in 80,000 companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on with loneliness.
Peter, one of the best business companies who died with the story, died with over the other years ago.
Peter's printer, before he started working with a company, Peter II, who said, "Make is actually unaware of a society and the economy."
So, the failure of entrepreneurs's life is the death of the spirit.
So you build Christ's work without knowing what the most human being-sood-de-e-a-day man is doing with her money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get it to you.
You have to give them a sense of discourse and privacy. You have to help them to help them, and they're going to be cunning.
In a community of 10,000 people, we'll get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people who have intelligence and passion?
What's the exciting thing you've ever done today?
"Hear, passionate people. You've got this. You've got it.
I want to say that entrepreneurs are the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we have wireless, automation, manufacturing, and suddenly there's systems that are not sustainable.
The control of the engine is not sustainable.
The technology of the unconcession is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we can feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, we can use, and we can use them to deal with them.
The technology is not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Are universities? You stop!
The government? You're sorry!
It's entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a pre-exventical magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the city of New York in 18950s.
In 18 months, they came together and they were re-created, which would happen in 100 years ago in the city of New York, and the conclusion was a popular city: New York City would not exist 100 years ago.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grew up, they needed six million horses to get it, and it would be impossible to get the stuff that's been done with six million pounds of dung.
Because they're already on the crap.
18teenteen years, they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 2008, there was 100 dollars of automotive, 100 dollars.
The idea that another technology had done was a total race. There was little factories in the middle of the country.
Oid, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered to do a discusal.
And they don't come to you and talk to you.
Next thing you have to do is to give them absolute and creative services.
You have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest company, the biggest company has to do three things that are needed to sell, and the product needs to be super-created, and the financial sector has to be massive.
You guess what?
We've never met a single person who's going to sell something that can sell and buy money.
This is not something that exists.
This person was never born.
We've been doing research, and we've seen 100 states of the world -- Carnegie, the Tom, the New York, the new companies, Google, Google.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have had, just one person has been founded.
Now we're teaching a 15-year-old farmer in North America, and we're starting to give them the class to give them two sides of Richard Phystics's job. The second is the two-year-old team, the first two words that he uses the word "Mritics" is called the word "I" of the word."
Never before, and 32 times.
He was not alone when he started.
Nobody did a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where a small leader who's sitting in the cafic background and they're all sitting in cafes and they're all like, "Mool, your boss, who's doing what someone who's done with this guy who's already going to be talking about, who says, "What's going to be going to be here."
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "I'm sure I think I'm going to make you for somebody?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are trained to help the companies in their own, and we found out that the magic system of the local government, the culture of the organization, and the culture of the culture is able to change the world, just by the ability of the power of the power of the power of the power of the world.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should be, Alice's miracles in the country.
The University of State University asked me -- a <unk>amp;D.<unk> to be a leader for communication -- engineers are working on communication.
I was afraid.
Simply. I'm afraid of these students with their large brains and their large books and their large stories, I don't really believe in words.
But as the conversation began, it made me like Alice, when she saw it down, he saw the blood and a door in a completely new world.
I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed about the thoughts that they had, and they wanted to find out that other wonder of the country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication to change our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the biggest problems, like energy and health, and if we don't understand it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to happen. I think it's not that we're not a journalist in our responsibility.
But these amazing conversations are not going to work if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to be invited to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, let's go and look at us.
I want to show you a couple of ways of how to do it, we can see that science and technology is busy working with you, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, what's going on?
So let's tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
It's not just that you're studying your guts, but we also say that your pesine structure is actually studying the light structure of our bones, because it's important to understand that it's important to cure Greeceia and preventia.
And if you do that, what makes you, then you're going to have preventable words.
There's a gap between understanding your mind.
Now, you can't use your free time and time and time, but why not just make you open and time, what is much more exciting for us?
We've got to understand our idea is not the same thing that they're going to take out of your level.
As Einstein said, "Moo things just like this, but not easier."
You can't tell you about your scientific area, without having to deal with trade.
Some things are about, examples, stories and online, so you can put it into your search.
And if you're trying to use your work, then you'll take the dots away.
Have you ever asked, why is it the point?
What happens if someone has a question? Another one is just a little bit of time and with these first dots, your audience.
A slide like this is not boring, but it's also about the work of the work-making part of our brain, and it's rapidly focused on it.
This example of genes of Gene Brown Brown is a very effective example. You can see that the special structure of the slime mold is so powerful that it actually took the inspiration of the Long Long River.
The trick here is to use a single sentence, just to keep the audience, and it can lose the screen, and it's also the images that are, and it's also creates a deeper understanding of what it is.
These are just a few ways that can help us open this door and see the miracles of the country, the science and the science of technology.
There are the engineers I taught, I taught, with the <unk>amp;<unk> I want to put everything in my deep, I want to put it on a equation.
Look at your science and your text and your text, you can put it through the discourse, and so the audience is important, and it's the whole thing that you've done with your passion, and it's amazing, and it's a tremendous set of new insights that are completely different.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I've always been interested in it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
You can actually film a crime in Syria in Syria.
You can go to a phone phone, you can run a message and you can start a conversation in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, it's going to be famous at sound and famous.
All this is possible with a cell phone.
I've lived in 1994, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
You can see how many thousands of people went out to change the street and they were looking at the road.
We've been in the fall of 1988, and we've got to imagine that all these people who have been tracking and they had a phone in the pocket.
Who has a cell phone?
Go ahead.
You're going to keep your phones up, you're going up.
Hold it up. A Android, a iPhone, wow.
There's a lot. Almost every cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my phone phone and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk to you about this.
This is 35 degrees of data.
Pange data.
And why is this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.N. has a line of a line.
This is a law of law enforcement.
The law is that every phone company in Europe has to store every Internet in Europe, a range of data in Europe, a range of data that has to store.
Who is calling? Who is going to send a email?
Who is going to send a text?
And if you use a cell phone, where you're.
All this information is going to be used for six months to the phone company or your Internet phone.
And everywhere in Europe, people were walking up and said, "We don't want to do it."
They said, we want to do this trade-based sanitation.
We want to do self-esteem in the digital age, and we don't want to have the phone companies and Internet services and Internet services to all of these information.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to do."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people on the streets were called Berlin, and they said, "Tood fear."
And some of them said, well, this could be called the line of 2012.
The rock was the pistoloci in East Central America.
And I also wonder, well, what does that work?
So, can all this information go from us?
Every time I use my phone?
So I asked my phone company, the telegraph, the biggest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them to send all the information that you've made me.
And I asked her, and she said, "I didn't have a right answer. It's just a light-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, it's the data that's behind it.
So I decided to put a court program on it because I had to have this information.
But the Great Review said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison.
I'm going to go back to what they've all sent me to the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of the E.S. is the prime line of law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown, brown, with a CD.
And on the CD, it was.
3588 lines on information.
First, I saw it, and he said, well, it's a huge record. My hand.
But then I realized, well, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this stage.
So I was a little bit skeptical, which is what I'd like to start with?
Because you see where I'm sitting at night, what I'm going to sleep.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what's called the security supply system means.
So with the time, online and open data, I've done this.
This is an animation of six months of my life.
You can zoom down and zoom down, you can go back and go back and forth.
You can take a step that I do, go back.
And you can see, as I'm going to take the train to the train of Swurt, and how many calls I do.
And all of this is possible to do this information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not about me.
It's all about us.
First, it's just like I call my wife and she calls me and we talk a few times.
And then I call a couple of friends and call them each other.
And after a while, you call it, and you call it, and we have this huge communications system.
But you can see how people communicate to each other, they call each other when they're going to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like the leader.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction platform for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who is talking to who is going to send a email that's possible to you, if you've got access to this information.
And this information is being cut for six months, in Europe until two years.
So I said, first, we've said that all these people in the streets would have had had in the fall of the mountain in 1988, in 1988.
And the song had found who was in the demonstration, and when the gods had been, then the leader would have never happened.
The case of the Berlin wall would not have happened.
And yet, the case of the Arctic Canyon.
Because the state of the country today and companies have to use so many information that they can get to do on us, online and online.
They want to have the ability to take our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But self-interest and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you say that your friends are a global issue of 21st century, and that's not the old age.
If you go home, you say, you're going to give your chiefs, because companies and government have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long yet.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to get information that you've done.
So in the future, every time you use your phone phone, remember you have to fight your self-interest in digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central Central, the rapid-time restaurants, the open-up spaces.
So the city map is going to change the name of South Central Central Africa, and it's going to change it for something else, it's changing it in New York City, and it's something that changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Pimpous fruit, rapid restaurants, the open-up spaces.
About 22, 25 million Americans, I live in the food city City Los Angeles, the home of Dr. Riszz, and the Dr.
The weird thing is that Dr. Bensy people are killing more people than the Dr.S.
People in South Central Central Los Angeles are dying of unomable diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in the Swiss River, which is about 15 miles.
I couldn't get to the idea.
And I asked myself, how would you feel if you had access to healthy food, if you see the same effects that you see in your house, the negative systems that have in your homes.
I've been able to buy a wheel and sold like transportation.
I see a conversation called a cartoon of mine, like Starbucks.
And I realized that's going to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no more funny than a 10-minute, and I had no idea of getting a apple that's not under the biological plant.
So I moved a food pump from my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, the city is heard.
But you have to do it.
So I think, "I can do what I want to do, because I'm responsibility, and I have to be in the way."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and I got my group, the L.C. Green. And we started to plant my food and fruit, and we put all the program, and so on, the whole program, vegetables, vegetables.
We've got a kind of a set of research group, they're all together from all the different forms of the city, and all the way out of the city is completely free, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone turns out.
The city came to me and he was basically a waste and said that I have to make my garden, the engine was a concite of a concite.
And I thought, "Well, come out, right?
A lot of people who are using food from a piece of food in a country, who is not?
And I thought, "Dool. Move it."
Because this time it didn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Loscio was doing a story about the city and with a member of Green. She was a petition. She was successful at the National Park and we were successful at the top of the top of the board.
We thought we had the victory in the hands.
My city, even though he called and said that they can support and love what we do.
So, right, why should they not do that?
L.A. has the most of the open-up spaces in the city.
They have 14 miles of the jet.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant about 725 million eggs in bees.
Why would it not have to find it OK?
As you can get to the plant, you'll get 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
With green oil, you get a dollar and you're going to get vegetables and vegetables in the cost of 75 dollars.
It's my name of mine, I'm telling people that they're going to grow their own food.
It's like your own food is to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I got my sons there.
And I am more confident, part of this unconportable reality that was made by other people, and I've been able to make my own reality.
You see, I'm a artist.
I'm a graffiti work. I'm going to put my art.
It's like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm going to make a closed, I'm going to make my lawn and the air.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants are my trees and the trees are my way to do this stuff.
They were surprised to use what the soil can do, if you use it on the screen.
You can't imagine how amazing a sun is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden, like my garden was made for the education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're on the ground.
They'd be wondering how children are affected by them.
And I've been able to see the most powerful and the most exciting act that you can do in the middle of the city.
You can get more and more fish.
I remember this time, when this mother came out, and her daughter came out about 10 minutes. They were in my backyard, and I looked up and they looked like this.
I felt bad because they were there, and I said, "You don't have to do that.
The garden is not why the street is.
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that was what I was doing with, and people who said, "I'm not afraid, you're not afraid of getting food."
And I said, "The devil, no, I'm not afraid that they're doing what they're doing.
It's about the road.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take care of your health."
Another time I put a garden in this homeless neighborhood in L.A.
These are the guys that helped me to put the wheel up.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how they've been growing and they've been growing up with her mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even for a moment.
Green Beats have already been covered about 20 landscapes.
To our search of the oil, so 50 people came and they're all volunteers.
When babies grow carbon, babies eat carbon dioxide.
When they grow fruit, they eat hormones.
But if they're not offered it, if they're not shown, like food and body, they eat, they're all about what they do.
I see young people who want to work, but they're in this thing -- I see color-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
This is the way I see a chance where we can train these kids to care about their communities to create a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Carro.
But if we change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do this.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of the park where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a ship of a bomb and then turn it into healthy cafeteria.
So, don't understand me.
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about people who are working, and children from the streets, and they're the joy and the pride of the pride, when you build your own food, and when you open up the banks.
So what I want to do here is to make it sexy.
I want to say that all ecological, barry, barry, the gangiest.
We have to zoom through the picture of the gang.
If you're not a pist, you're not a gang.
You're going to get a lot of time to go, right?
And let's take the gun.
If you want to meet me, don't call me, if you want to sit in the crazy and you want to do a meeting where you're talking about it.
If you want to meet me, you'll come to your garden, in my backyard, so we can plant any of these.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford English is "The Sollyyy."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "The Thusy" means "nood" is a non-ex-ex-ex-nanceistististist."
In the 19th century, a newspaper of a better definition: "Hicky, somebody who has a bank, or a bank, or its success, its success of its success, its success of the law of the law of the law of the law.
I have no idea what's called "cood."
Think about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to use language.
Twenty-five years ago, for example, the British minister, the pressed newspapers, not the exact word of the news.
And that's actually what happened to the courage of a man with extraordinary name called Codon, who was in the parliament.
She put him in the spring of London and he was a man, but he was a strong, he was able to stop, and he finally had so much support in London.
And a few years later, we find the first term for the sentence, which is very strong, many people believe.
Bele to the English word for a bus.
But that's not true. It's going to be back to a pre-creating press of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to the United States at the time they've been doing independence.
You've looked at the question, how do you call George Washington, the state of the state?
You didn't know.
What is the leader of a foreign nation?
It's been a long-term deal on Congress.
And there were all sorts of things that we had.
I wanted to call some people Washington, and others, and other, the heart of Washington, and another time, the power of the people in America's country.
It's not a kind of a funning.
Some people wanted to call him king.
They thought it's a legitimate thing.
They were not a non-religist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period.
It could have been working.
But everybody was madly boring, because this debate was three weeks ago.
I read the days of a law, always writing, "I've been thinking about the same topic.
The reason that the long-term was so upset was that the visual drone was on the edge.
The most popular drone didn't want to be a good thing to do Washington's Washington. They didn't want to do it.
The king, and maybe it can take to the ideas.
They wanted to give him the most powerful, unenfortful title that they could do.
This title was "The Rerace."
President. They didn't invented the title. But he didn't. He just thought that someone had a meeting.
It's something like a failure.
He had no longer the size of the term "cood" or "catat".
Sometimes there was a handful of vicial and government and government, but it was really a misconquusive title.
That's why the bank was coming.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to be elected and criminalized.
Who is going to take it seriously if he's got a little title of the United States's United States?
And it's about three weeks ago, the NSA didn't go.
Instead, you've never thought about it, the title of "The Reem" but they wanted to understand it completely wrong, and they didn't have to be honest with the unconcessive and the legitimate, whether it's in the state of the United States, whether it's not the state of the United Nations, it's not the end of the world.
You can learn about three interesting things.
One, and I think it's the best -- until now I can't figure out if the S<unk>S. has ever been the president.
Obama, President Obama, has just been able to get the title of my dream. He's just ready to get the U.S.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something that's a slow-tech -- then you're going to wait at 23 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of America is not so slowly so easily, right now.
This has been done with a little bit of a 5,000-dollar-fiving valleys that has been, and the largest economy of the world's economy and a drone of drones and all this stuff.
It's just a story and story that has given me the size.
And this is how the end is won.
They have a respective title.
And the other concern about the end of the law, the head of self-esteem -- now it was.
You know how many nations have a president?
14.
Because they want to sound like this guy on the 5,000 nuclear war and so forth.
So at the end of the Senate, the original and the representation of the hospital, no one feels, if you're told, you're going to be the president of America.
And this is the most important thing that you can do, and I'm going to leave you with.
Politics are trying to use words to control reality and the reality, but actually the reality of the reality is to change the reality of the word as much as the reality of the reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a bar about 50 cents to fight to the war, a 10-year-old, a 15-year-old, a bogy of Michaelville.
I was looking at my black-old hip-and-old hip-in-in-pater-in-pater-pater-pord-pord-pord-cord-cord-cord-cord-cord-creating rocket that I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I had just been able to get through the war, but next to Mr. Kahama and football and football and a green-class and popularist-Americans, and the Colombian protesters, the unconventionalists, the government, the government, the government of Russia, the way I knew that I knew was able to do.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm here, I've been able to feel a very, a <unk>amp;<unk>amp;<unk>unclear<unk>, South African-Americans, and a radical artist who lived the last year, who's been working in Afghanistan, and I've been working on.
So there's a lot of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I want to paint my own rain. I want to make art, and I want to make the character that makes the character and the connection and the connection that is going to be able to use a sense of harmony and the landscape that we can use.
I want to spend a day of a jihad -- a leader who was used to fight his jihad against the terrorist community, like "Batat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-Bat-s" and religious corruption."
And what else can do is make the jihad, as the minister to the National Bank and a choice campaign, "Tould I do it." I'm rich."
And to use this campaign to let this monococociii, which is about the National Geographic.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rick" where you're going to be a wrong control on the street and the road, instead of the cars, and they're going to take money from the road and they're going to get their money to the police, and they hope that they hope that they hope that they can hope that they can hope that they will hope to take 100 percent of the police.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the informal conflict.
The war and the religious beliefs that came to him was created a new environment for theater and fashion, which is only able to capture the way to treat a fashion for suicide and suicide bombers, I created a local criminal, a local, a pisticist, a pisticist, a pisticicic, a pisticic, a pisticicicic, a conservation, a pistic-cord-cord-cord-cord
And I would like to see how a simple slick from midnight's Poscopic app is going to create a dialogue about the development of the development of the development of the development of its international development of the American war has had had had been known to have the black-Americans and even to protect him.
But for all these things, you can get into jail, they can't be misawarely misaware.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self.
This is my favorite. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Samuel Franklin, and I work for a while I work as a model.
Thirty years ago, I said, right.
I have the sense that now a complete tension in the room, because I would not have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit of change.
This is the first time that someone is going to be able to get to the TED stage, so you can really get happy to see.
If a few women were really flipped, I've got to say, you don't really want to say this, I'll read it later later on Twitter.
I also find myself very lucky, because I can change 10 seconds of thinking about what you think.
It's not the chance.
These are very, very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear it.
The most important part is to move your head over my head, because you'll all do anything, so you're not doing it until I'm on my head.
Okay.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it's not so embarrassing as this image.
A visual image is powerful, but a visual is also a visual.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I wanted to put my back and put my hand on the hair.
And instead of the wrong and the wrong bamps that I've been doing two days ago in work, there's very few ways to change our own ideas, and our fears -- even if there's no-effective impact in our lives.
Unless fear is to me, to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a beautiful lady, and I call it a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but to be honest.
The first question is, "How will you do a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh, I discovered it. It doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I was a model was a strategy is a profit in the genetic and a great legacy, and maybe you might ask what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have no beauty as healthy and young and beautiful, we're programmed to express what's called recognition, but also as big as a man, lesbian, and pink and bright.
This legacy was designed for me, and it's a legacy that's so ready for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some kind of a fashion call, "Hoy, Mr. Roy, Goy. Hoy.
And I'm just talking about the model of model. It's pretty amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very successful Ph.D. student, all the way that they've been doing was to get the entire, and that every single one has been cuted by 14,000 units, and that's not even six percent.
The next question that I've always asked is, "Can I be a model when I am adult?"
And I said, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to do is to give this little girl, why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can be President's president of the United States or the inventor of the Internet or a neo-m-old surgeon, which is completely unconstanged, because you would be the first.
And after she's going to say, "No, no, Craig, I want to be a model," I'll say, "Who's my boss."
Because I didn't have responsibility for it, and you could have the boss of the American bird, or the business of H<unk>amp;M, or the next words.
And to say, you're going to be a model, and you'll say, as you'll say, you'll have to win the guy in the E.S.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of model model, because the heart of the brain can now be able to get it.
If there's a photographer there, and there's a little bit of light, like a nice, and the driver says, "Don, we want to take a photo, and then it's going to be nice, and it's going to be nice, and then, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, that arm, and then it's going to the back, and
It looks like this.
I hope that's less weird than the middle.
This was -- I don't know what's going on.
If you've finished school and you've done a life and a few jobs, you can't say, you're not going to say a lot more. If you want to be president of the United States, you're going to be in your life, "Mone-Mobile, you're going to be able to see a strange,
The next question that I've been asked is, "Who's all the photos?"
And yes, it's all the photos that are being cut, but this is just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photo that I did, and it was the first time I had a Bethon, I didn't even have my time.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
And I just saw a couple of months before my grandmother.
This is me the day of this rock.
My friend had to come up with me.
This is me at a Saturday party, a few days ago on a TV that's French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V.D.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're constructed, and they're a group of professionalists, from Haphic and the Tell and the founder of the team and the editors and the editors and the manufacturers and the manufacturers and the manufacturing industry. I'm not.
Okay, next, the people always ask me, "Do you stop doing things free?"
Yes, I have a lot of 10-minute flaps that I can't wear, but I'm not going to get the things that I'm going to get, the things that I'm going to get in real life, and I don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and had my money, and you had to stop the clothes for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with a terrible bus, and she was about a red light, and of course we had to stop it. It was just like, "Hood, Mr. Teszler, Mr. Teszler, I could go back.
I've got this cost of things because of my appearance, and not because of my personality, and there are people who are telling their appearance, and not for their personality a high price.
I live in New York, and about the 140 teenage teenagers who were arrested last year and was 85 percent of black and black men.
It's only 17,000 young, black black and white and Asian, which is not the question: "Who am I going to stop?"
I said, "How often am I going to get? When I'm going to get caught?"
I found out of my research, that 35 percent of the entire 12-year-old girls in the United States don't like this, and that number is 90 percent, when they've become 17 percent.
The last question I've been asking is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they expect this answer: "If you've got a little bit of a little bit of hair, you've got a little bit of hair, you feel very happy and very happy."
And we give a answer, maybe this idea is what I'm going to give you.
We say, "It's really great to travel, and it's great to work with creative people, loving people."
It's true, but it's only half of the story, because we never mentioned the camera before I said, "I feel safe."
And I feel safe, because I have to think about my view every day.
And if you ask, "Do I happier, if I had a thin legs and a bright hair?"
You'd have to make a couple of pieces of stuff, because they have the most thin legs, and the most cool hair that they're and they're all about their appearance, and they probably probably probably probably probably are the most vulnerable women on the planet.
And when I was prepared to do this talk, I realized it was a very difficult journey, because I felt very uncomfortable to say, "I've got the benefits of a boat, and I've been able to feel like, "I've been able to feel a whole bunch of money, and he's not going to feel so hard."
It was really difficult to use a legacy of gender and race, if I was one of the biggest payers.
But I'm also happy to be honored, and I think it's great, and I think I've done it before 10 years or 30 years ago, and I would not tell my job, but I would have been able to tell my job, or I would not have done my job, I would have done that.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all have the power of the image in our mind and predicting the misconception.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who've been told in the exertion of life: "Son, the pistolis, the resistance.
But I'm never going to be able to do something like a G<unk>lai revolution."
It's almost two years since the Foscopic revolution, inspired by the waves of mass-creating and the Egyptian revolution.
I was also surrounded by many other other other wilds, and in outside, to try to get a day of the anger and to get a revolution to the terrorist regime.
And there's a big revolution.
Boy, Mick and men in the first row, the end of the memorial, the end of the authorities thought was the freedom of freedom and the freedom of justice and social justice.
They've been able to prove a very unusual courage to do with the violent civilocracy.
They have a strong sense of instability, from the east, to the deep West, to the south.
After a period of six months of war and nearly 5,000 dead deaths, we've been able to fight our country and to fight the truth.
Now, Kafi has a great home, a legacy of the political, corruption and the foundation.
Over the course of decades, Govus's regime and infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the mythic society is destroyed.
The destruction and the challenges, I realized how many women, who are working on the civilism of Brazil, and we asked a legitimate and a democratized democracy.
Thirty organizations were now in the case of the Gukzzz, in Nisz, almost 300 in the arop.
After 9<unk>11 years ago, I came back to Licasas, and I started to develop physical love, to develop the ability of the ability of human development, human development, human development.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace community of women, a movement of women, leaders, their own life, their goal, is to be able to open up the public, to fight the political and our women's right to the right-being of peace and peace.
I met the financial response, I met a very difficult environment, and it's all the more powerful, a system that was designed by the political politics of politics.
I was offered a campaign of peacebuilding, to get a more-in-pander law, a law that should give every citizen, no matter what the truth should be, and to put on a political election and political property and political property and its female rights and its gender market to a large line.
And we've been able to get into our mission and successful.
Women won nine percent of the nation's state in the first elections since 34 years.
But long, the war was safe, but the war penalty revolution and the whole revolution was, because every day we were to get new news from violence.
We were looking at the news of the guerrillas and the Arab and the poets.
Another morning, we got messages about the American and the attack on the message.
After another morning, the suicide bombers were sent to the army.
And every day, we're at the law of the military and their efforts to fight the human rights and their judgment and the laws of law.
Our society, created by a revolution, polarized, polarized, and they were reacted by the ideals of the laws and principles, dignity, social justice, social justice.
Beess, misfort, and R<unk>s<unk>s<unk> and the magic was the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you to be the success of the success of our success and the elections.
I've been here today to say that we've had a nation that has the wrong choice and the wrong decisions.
We've been missing our priorities.
Because the elections didn't have peace or security in Lyia.
Did the hard-tuning and the shift between female and female rights and national peace?
No, it didn't.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to continue to be re-in-created and re-in-created politics and the unomfort of women and men?
Perhaps the women who didn't have the same, but the female's values of compassion, the G<unk>s and the S<unk>s.
Our society needs to be a national dialogue and a memory process as it needed the elections, the end of the polarization and the continuity.
Our society needs to have the psychological pulse of the female's disease more than the standard, the negative, the head of the female.
We have to stop the name of the anger and a day to get the stigma.
We have to start thinking about the compassion and the Good.
We have to develop a female discourse that is not only about the values, but also to the proximity, instead of the competition, instead of a competition, instead of a law,
These are the ideals that have to be a war-like vony, to get peace.
Because peace has an Alelon and in this Alieon, it's about the cortisol and the gus of the arolic and the pony.
This is the real, real-sense.
And we have to do that, before we do it, we're doing it in a sociological way.
After a stop of the Koran's "Sad" -- "the God" is the word of the S<unk>nood<unk>n<unk>n<unk>n<unk><unk>n<unk><unk>n<unk><unk>n<unk><unk><unk><unk>n<unk><unk><unk>n<unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk>
The word "wood", which is known in every post of the literature, has the same Arabic, the word "The mother" and its mother, the dominant, the whole man, the man, the man's soul of all the human and the female's rights.
And just like the mother's brain, the embryo, which is growing in it, completely, is the same thing that is the dominantness of compassion.
And so we said, "My God's all things are going to be."
And so we said, "My God's head has been in front of my work."
So let's make sure that all the gakes are going to be the most successful.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "The Recess."
And I was very proud.
In school, we've been thinking about the story of Joe L<unk>S, but we've been not learning very much about the world, except America, South Korea, South Korea and Japan.
And while I asked myself how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my life in North Korea, to keep it all over time.
When I was seven years old, I saw a public transport, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to suffer.
But in 1994, my mother took a letter from my sister's sister.
And he said, "If you're here, five family members are not more than we've been eating it since we've had two weeks ago.
We're all together on the ground, and our body is so weak that we're going to die."
I was shocked.
I heard the first time that people were in my country.
I was just going to go back to the highway, and I saw something that I can't get through my memory.
A pic-in-e-e-law was on the ground, and a broken child in his arm, and it's a little bit of a sudden-to-old kid in his mother.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy to care about their families and their families.
In the 1990s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, there were more than a million North Korea who had been blinded to the victims, and many times more people, because they ate grass and the red and the red.
Power of electricity has been more likely to keep it out of the night, but the lights of China on the other side of the bank that we've met.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the orchestra, the part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, and it can allow North Carolina to be able to escape.
But many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't tell you how I left North Korea, but I can say that I was sent to the death of the death of the death of the war to China.
I just thought I was separated for a short time from my family.
I had never thought it's 14 years to work again.
China was very hard to live with a young girl without family.
I had no idea about how the life was, as the Northwest country would be, but I realized that it's not very, very, very, very, very, very dangerous, North Ireland, northern refugees in China.
So I lived in the constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me to a horrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest birthday was true when I was in the Chinese police and I was attacked in the police department.
Somebody who was offered me to be North Carolina, so they tested my Chinese and asked me to make me a lot of questions.
I had this fear, I thought I would explode.
Something that's unomfortable, I could be trapped and hidden.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made it my feelings and I asked the questions.
After the talk, they were asked to do something, a police officer said, "This was a false bomb.
She's not North<unk>nan."
And they took me. It was a miracle.
Some North Korea, he's looking at the law of illegal messages, but many of the people who are already released from the Chinese police.
These girls had a big fortune.
Even though they're released, they were finally released by tremendous international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so lucky.
Every year, North Korea are killed in China and they're already released in North Korea, where they're being executed or buried in public public.
Even though I had been to the spring, I've had a lot of North Carolina.
It's tragic that North Korea has to hide their identity and struggle to fight and fight.
And after she's learned a new language and work, they can actually put their world into a moment.
After 10 years of the shock, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started to start a new life.
I went to South Korea, and I thought it was a bigger challenge than I thought I would have.
English was so important in South Korea, so I had to learn my third language.
And I've also discovered the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Japanese, but we've been very close to a very close part of the side of the age of 14 years.
I was walking through a identity.
Am I a South or North Carolina?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that could have been there, that could be my home.
Although my strength was not easy to me, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording of the university.
Just as I was more engaged by my new life, I got a really scary call.
The North Central Bank began to put the money that I sent my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to escape a remote place.
They had to be able to fly quickly as fast as possible, so I started to plan their journey.
North Korea have to go back to a incredible route to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China and I took me to the southwest border.
Because my family didn't talk about Chinese, I had to give them to the more than 2,000 miles from China, and then then South Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we've been nearly nearly a thousand times.
Once the bus was on, a Chinese police police officer came in.
He took the point of all the people, and started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand a Chinese, I thought I would be able to get it.
When the Chinese officer was in my family, I decided to be blind, and she said she was a royal and I was her to be a sign.
He looked at me, but luckily he believed me.
We've managed to get the edge, but I had to put all my money to get the border of Lus's border.
But after we've been to the border, my family was unacted, because of illegal border.
After my money, I paid money and paid a job, my family was released in a month, but after my family, my family was replicated in the capital of L.K.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had all the things to make my family go, and we were so close to the freedom, but my family was just to get the South Bronx's name.
I went out and I went out and I went to the battlefield and the police department, and I tried to fight my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay money to pay money to money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then I asked the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In English, with a dictionary, I explained to him without a law, and he went to a bank and paid the money to my family and two North Korea to get to jail.
I was delighted to tell him about my heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I'm going to say."
I'm going to call the North African people."
I realized that this is a symbol of real time in my life.
The earlier people who had been inspired by a new hope that the North Korea had to have so much, and he showed me the friend of the boss and the support of the international community as the international government, the North Korea.
Finally, after our long journey, my family was, and I moved to South Korea, but the freedom is just to move.
Many North Korea are separated from their families, and as soon as they get into a new country, they start to start with nothing else.
The international community can help education, the English, the work of education and the education of the education and many more.
We can also change the bridge between people in North Korea, and the outside of the world, because a lot of us are still standing in with families and we send information to change the water, North Korea,
I had so lucky, so much of the help in my life, I want to be able to get my most amazing Northwest-Americans, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Korea around the world, but also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just got a message today.
Please tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Kii is two, and very good, very good.
He can't talk about it, but he's also learning about how some of the best speakers could not.
It's a myth, it's love.
He's going to collect it, and he's going to put it down.
It's not a cist. He doesn't look at the skin.
He didn't care about religious differences, and they're just saying, "There's no one lie.
When he was writing songs of our childhood, he's trying to try to think about words that I'm not even reminded of, just like we know something that's going to be so wonderful about the mind and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good.
He's absolutely unconable memory.
He also has a double-up.
He can't remember if he's stolen chocolate, but he's remindeding the report of every song on my iPod, where we had four conversations that were the first result of my arm, when he had the first one of my arm on my arm and his brother's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But many people don't want to be right.
And in fact, because your mind is not in the social version of normal version, they're often understood about it.
But what my heart was encouraged to do, and my soul was that although it was not as usual, it was just that it was, it was a single one: it was actually psychic, it was extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't really know the term of "cophicism" is a complex disorder of the brain, the social communication of creativity, the learning of physical abilities.
It's actually different than any individual, and it's a cartoon of Sam.
And the world is going to be discovered 20 minutes of autism, and although it's one of the fastest-growing development systems in the world, there's no cause of cure or cure.
And I can't remember the first time when I'm a neuroscientist, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old, when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He's very much of the time he's talking.
He didn't want to play the same thing that the other babies did, and actually he didn't really care about me.
And he lived in his own world, and he was able to put his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things like cars in a space, and they're going to eat the machine and eat everything that was coming out of him.
And as he was older, it was different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the rawn and the end of hyperactivity, something was really unaware of a simple, a boy who saw the world without the world, never had ever seen.
It's unusual.
Now, I can't believe that there was some more exciting moments in my family, moments that I wish I was.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of things that I've taught, about personal communication, and love, and I understand that these things that I wouldn't want to be more rational.
And empathy is looking at the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we're different is not that we're wrong.
It means there's another kind of thing that's right there.
And if I could only say a thing to a name and Sam, then you'd have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, with autism, the differences that we have, we have, we have a gift! Everybody has a gift. And in all of the way, the pursuit of equality is the ultimate potential of self-interest.
The chance of scale, progress and change, in the moment we try to do something else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Edononon, we've been obsessed with curiosity, and this photo, with a shark, and with a signal of a supernova of a century.
Now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and the world doesn't see a million or a billion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography that can create a new engineering technology that can actually create it as fast as it can be able to create a slow-up-up-up-up-up-up-by-time-by-time motion.
And we can build cameras that can look at the outside of our view of a screen or a neuro-scapse image in our body, and we really do what we've done with my camera.
Now, if I take a laser, and I take it in a second-by-by-by-half seconds, and this is the number of extra dimensions, I'm going to make a laser that's hardly a thin, and this is a thin, and this is a thin piece of light that's going to be moving, and it's going to be moving in the speed of light, and it's going to be a second speed of light, and it
So if you take this project, this photot-touch, and you can put it in this bottle, like these photons in the bottle?
What's going on in slow motion?
So, this event --
So, think about it, it's actually going to be less than a nanoscopic event, so it takes the light to this journey, but I've got this video to take 10 billion billion seconds to see the light.
No, Coca-Cola has not funded this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let's show you what's going on.
The pulse, the process of our project, goes into the bottle of a photot, and it starts to move through the skull, and then it's going to move through the back.
A part of the light is moving down to the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photos are actually going to the end of the bottle and explode in different directions.
You can see, there's a air that's moving around in the bottle.
And while the waves are in the table, and because of the images, you can see the reflection of the bottle is focused on a few images.
Now, if you take a classic project, and you can take it back and take the same time, and you know, the video is about 10 billion times, you know how long you have to see the movie.
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring movie -- from a slow project, normal project in motion.
And what's going on with a more awkward memory?
You can see again, like this waves, the Tom's box, and the wall is running around the background.
It's like you get a stone in a pond.
And it seemed like this, as a picture of nature, it would be like a photo, a pair of a screen, but it looks like our eye is actually a picture of a picture.
But if you look at that Tom's seat, then you'll see that if the light is going to be released, it's not going to be dark.
Why? Because Tom's left is, and the light is going to go around and every hundred seconds later.
So in the future, if this Mail-M-M-M-Maf is built in your desk, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if a fruit flies are not there, it's not even to touch.
So what's my team built on MIT?
So as a photographer, as a photographer, you know, if you've done a photo of a long time, you've got very little light, but we've got a billion times faster than your long-term expansion, so you'll get it, so you'll get it so much.
So what we're going to do is we're going to send this project, this phototod, a thousand-pound, and then we're going to try and put it through the data and we're going to create these data, and we'll show these data to make these video videos.
And we can take all these materials and take it to do very interesting things.
So Rick, they can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how would it be a new power for a future of new super-tech heroes?
The idea is that we're going to make a light on the door.
It's going to go down into space, a part of it, and then it's going back to the door, and we could take this extra bit of light to the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, we see our Fail camera.
On the wall, a pic is hidden, and we're going to take the light back to the door.
After our paper, the National Public Public System was published, it was made of naturalcom.com, and they've created these animation.
We're going to take this light project back, and they're going to be able to put this back into the wall and these photons, and they're going to be able to get all the images that are going to be able to get the light and then the light that's going to get the light, and then the light will be able to turn back to the back of the left, and then it's going to the light, and then, it's
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our F-R-R- camera has a unique abilities.
She has a very good time to look at the world in the speed.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what's going on.
So, if we can take a laser, we can take a light-up picture, which is like this -- not really -- but if we do all these images, these images, these images, and they try to analyze the different light, and then we can actually analyze the object.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our creationization.
We've got to do a little bit more, and before we can do this in the lab, we could actually avoid cars, and we can see what's going on on, and we can look at the curve, and we can look at the light, we can actually turn it into the open light, we can actually turn it into the open light, or we can actually turn it into the open light of the light, and we can see the light of the light, and we
But because of the pony and tissue, of course, is a very challenging approach, and that's actually what it's really meant to do with scientists now is to actually call a new visual visualization of the next generation of medical development.
So, like, for example, a second, a scientist, a science, a science, a science, a digital photo, and I realized that all of these data, we can't just collect the sequence of the sequence of the experiment, we can't just use a new sequence of light, and we can't just take a new sequence of light, and we can't just take a new sequence of light, and that one of the light, and that's not
But it's something that's happening here.
If you look at the waves of the bottles, you see that waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've seen it, because we've seen almost in the speed of light, weird effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture.
The sequence that happens in the world, in the world, is going to be seen in the camera, by looking at the relationship between space and time, we can fix that.
So, not to focus on photography or to explore a new visual representation of medicine, or new design, we have all of our data, and we hope that we can open up and hope that the key to the design of the research and the design of the online, the design of the design, the design of the key, the key to the data that we need to stop.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities that we can improve our lives.
We don't really make any neighbors on the street, so many of the wisdom is not going to be done, but we use the same public public spaces.
In the last years, I tried to share more and to share things like a little bit of like a little-touch and a box and a box.
The projects that were made up to my questions, how much money to raise my neighbors?
How can we stop doing things without ourselves?
How can we overcome our memories of the building and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the home, so that our communities and our dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is ripped by the giant es that had been in the past hundreds of years, love-to-cooded and shade, and I'm sure a city of the music has always been.
I think every time someone never knows, there's a bar in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city that's still behind most of the time in America.
I'm going to live in the place and I thought about how I can make it happen. And I thought it's always changed my life.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved me very much.
Her name was Kanan, and she was like a mother, and she suddenly looked at her. She suddenly looked at her.
I thought about death, and I felt a great joy for my life, and it took me to understand the things that I've been so important to me.
But it's hard to keep me to keep this view of every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I moved to a side of the house and wrote a huge box, and I wrote a little bit of the gaps: "I want to get every one, every one, every one, I want to think, is going to take a piece of silence and think about his life.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but I've been able to get the wall completely and grew up.
I want to share some sentences that were written by people on the wall.
I'm going to die with you, I want to be dismitting by the P<unk>amp;<unk>amp;<unk>s.
I want to die with you, I want to end up with the latest news line."
I want to be hungry, I want to sing for millions of people."
I want to kill you, I want to plant a tree."
I want to die, I want to live in the grid of blindness."
I want to die, I want to keep it once in my poor."
I want to die, I want to be a person's artwork."
I want to die, I want to be myself."
This was a place that was made in a sense of a meaningful place, and the dreams of people took me to laugh and feel like I was doing the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and it's a new and more inclusive way.
It's about how to create and think about it, and remember what we are most important and how we grow.
I've done this last year, and hundreds of messages that were trying to build a wall that was built with my colleagues and my colleagues, and I've built a platform in the world like Morocanan, South Africa, South Africa, South Africa, Australia, Australia, Australia.
We've shown how much power we have, if we have the opportunity to share our voices and to share more and more.
Two of the most valuable things we have, and the relationships are different people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to look at things that are at the right and think about life is a little bit more sensitive.
We're often talking about death, or only thinking about it, but I've realized that the lesson is about death is the thing that we're all deeply influenced.
The idea of death is what makes us alive.
Our common spaces are showing what we are as individuals and as a community, and more than the ability to share our hopes and stories that we can't help people to help us to make better places, to help us make better places better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm talking about it. I'm going to talk to a special problem for everyone who's busy working on math, that we're like business companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing.
Stiver is one of the most common activity.
We're careful about the blind ball and the bumble and the bumbles, as you see the same.
There's a massive amount of information that can be seen in the brain and abilities, and perhaps a fundamental, that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's ability to destroy this extraordinary ability. It also makes it happen to me in my name of Muhammad's Law, to be able to do the time of a ball.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
There's still 6.3 million people who have suffering from this disease, and they have to have to have the un-in-noodable, the unomfortable, the valleys of the valleys, the valleys, the disease that we need to find that disease is going to be able to discover before the disease is late.
We have to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately, the only way to know is to know if we have a objective amount of magnitude, that answer is the answer.
And there's a lot of trouble that it's used for Parkinson's disease and other activity, so you can't do simple blood analysis. It's the best thing that's going on in this 20 minutes of the test.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside of clinical studies, it's never going to happen.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
This would be a tour of tours that would save the hospital. What if patients could do this test?
It's not a caropoly.
It costs 300, by the way, to explore the neurologic bubble.
So I want to suggest you a unconventional approach that we're trying to do, because we're all in a certain sense, at least my name of mine, my name of Honel.
Here's a video of the gluten of the sound.
This is happening in the normal state, if someone's reading sounds, we can look at the word-to-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-s.
And as a ball, the ball needs a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to talk about it.
And we can turn the position of the neural lobe, and like the limb is affected by Parkinson's muscles.
On the bottom, you can see an example of the supernovae of the slime mold.
We're still seeing the same symptoms.
Right, cou, cou, yood.
The language is still more blind and more comfortable, and this is an example of it.
This effects of voice can be trivial, sometimes with digital microphones, and it's based on the technology, with new processing software that's now advanced, so we can now see somebody in a case, where there's a disease, and only in the brain of the brain.
Now, how can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-lethalized, the test is the test.
It's just a little bit. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new hospitals for this.
And they're exactly exactly what's going on. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done in their own way.
They're very fast, pay 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is cheap, you can use it in a very large scale.
And this amazing goals we can now do.
We can reduce the math problem for patients.
Fimpers don't have to take feedback to the hospital.
We can get objective data from the historical observation.
We can do low-cost mass attacks for clinical studies, and we've been able to make a study of the entire population.
Now, we've got the ability to look at biomoscon, before we've been late.
Today, we're going to do the first step, we're going to start to see the Parkinson's disease.
A Cander and patient at VOLT, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough data to allow it to be able to do it.
We have a prediction of numbers that are available to a billion people on this planet.
Anyone, with Parkinson's disease, can call it cheap, for a few cents. I'm afraid that we've already had six percent of our goal.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can say, who are you healthy from who are they healthy and who?
What do you do with all these samples?
What's happening is that the patient has to be able to get to the call of the call, whether this person is suffering or not.
Some of them may not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, in different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we're going to figure out what the actual code is for Parkinson's equations.
At the time, your 86 percent is the speed of speed?
It's much better.
My students, I have to do it because he's done so amazing work, now it's already done on the mobile phone, and we're going to make it happen to be 99 percent.
This is what I call a stress.
This is what people can call the phone, and they can use the test with the phone, and they could call people Parkinson's test, send their voice to Parkinson's voice so that they can take the success of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Great and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya, in the middle of the Southwest Park.
In the background, you see the cows's father and the behind the kitchen is the Southwest park.
The National Park Park is actually a map in the South, and that means that the wild animals can't go to the park at any time.
The predators that follow the lions, and then they're going to follow it.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who died at night, and I was dead, and she was dead. It was absolutely the only gun.
My tribe, the tribe of the Asian, believe that we've come together with our animals and the Gulf of the sky, and so our animals were so much.
I learned lions as a child.
Our name name is called the protects of our tribe and our mother. They're also in this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think it's just a lot of lions in the middle of the park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years, the milk was responsible for his father. It was like me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that we didn't really help us, but the lions, the trees are better to see.
But I didn't go. I did. I went.
I had a second idea. I tried to put it on a bird.
I wanted to think that the lions thought I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You get out, you see the bird's bird's going back and they go back. And they're going to say, the thing is, it's not true.
And they're going to take it and kill our livestock.
One night I left the wheel. I went through a pel and I went around and we didn't kill the lions.
The lions fear of light, it moves.
I had a idea.
I worked on the whole day as a boy, and once I worked in my bedroom, and once the new radio, it took me all the day, but I had learned a lot of electronics.
I took a old battery and a motor, and it's a motor, and it shows if you want to turn your right or right, it's got to be bright.
And I took a switch to turn the lights and turn it back.
This is a little bit of a picpard of a broken box.
And then I built together. And then I built together.
The solar engine is controlling the battery, the battery uses electricity. I call it a blend.
And the real thing that's going on is that they're flashing.
You can see that the 17 is going out there, because the lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like to the lions when they come.
The lights are flashing and the lions believe that I'm going to go down. And I was all the time on bed.
Thank you.
I've been running this way to the house, and since we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard of them.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of animals on lions, and she asked me if I could put the lights.
And I said, "Yeah."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since I've been living seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they work really well.
My idea is now used to be used in Kenya, including fruit flies, or the lights, the lights also to keep elephants from the sea.
My invention took me to a meeting at a best school in Kenya, Brookor School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is working on it, and it helps to deal with donations and education.
I even had my friends home and we put the lights there where there's no lights there, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
A boy, a boy who was walking from the South Carolina, and I saw planes over and said, "I'm going to sit in a dinner."
And here I am.
I had to play with a plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane, and pilot, and this is my great dream.
I used to make lions. But through my invention, I can save the cows and the lions. We can live on the side with the lions, no argument.
Elizabeth Ol<unk> In my language, that means, I'm very much.
You don't know how exciting it is, a story about how you hear.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next list?
My next invention, now I work on a motor. A electroel?
Yeah, I know, electrical-touch has been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've just tried it, right, right, yeah, I've tried to try it, but I've been trying to get it back, because I got a -- I got a break.
Right. Richard Turbo, you're totally special.
We're going to give you a step of your home, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough, and I've got a camera in the hand, and I want to share my passion today, but I want to share my favorite show with you today, and no one I did.
There was no kind of a lexicist, no way to shoot a picture. It's not even the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot from the previous tourists.
My story begins as a talk for a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture, where I was at my birthday, and we were at the top of the morning, and five and five.
And we were in New York, and we decided to shoot the same picture once.
Well, yeah, you can see what's going on.
On the third birthday, my daughter said, "Hey, why do you do not go to New York and do it make a friend a birthday of mine to get the ritual to work?
And then we started asking a picture of tourists to make us a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture is when you're completely getting a whole stranger.
Nobody said no one, and fortunately, it's never even a guy with our camera.
And we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become deeply deeply alive.
This was just a weeks ago, and I had to explain what happened next day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than a single moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way to keep time in October, and we've been trying to change our time and how we've been going to change our year, not just physically, but physically, but to change.
Because while we do the same image, we change our perspective for time, and as they can, I can see new spaces, I can see the life with them, and how they see it.
This very high time we spend a little bit of time, and we expect it to be expected every year and every year.
In the short, while we went home, we were walking, and suddenly they were looking at the same, they're looking at a red ball on a ball that had been working on a little kid than a kid, before they've been in the previous days.
And she told me about their feelings that they had in the same place as five years old as they were in this place.
She said she's reminded her the heart of the chest when she saw nine years ago at the first time he saw the bank.
And now she looks at New York schools because they want to learn in New York.
And I realized that's the most important thing that we've created is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of a active role of memory.
I don't know how it looks like, but from 15 minutes, I'm not very much of a family photo.
I'm always the picture that makes it.
I want to introduce you to today to get you into the picture and not asking someone, "Do you want to do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 16.64, 47.2/23.2/12.3/6.8 (BP=0.956, ration=0.957)
