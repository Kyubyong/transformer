When I was 11, I was blown up one morning from the sounds of the bright joy.
My father listened to his little gray radio show on the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy at what was rather unusual at the time, because he was mostly stressed out the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father made it very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'm never going to forget.
A real school.
The Taliban tried to get the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I was committing for five years as a boy, and I was left by my older sister who was not allowed to be on a secret school.
Only that we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so nobody could guess where we were going.
We're hiding our books in shopping bags so it looks like we're just going to buy.
We've been doing this in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of a hilarious thing, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
After all, the class had to be held out for a week because the Taliban had swallowed thighs.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to demand us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school anyway.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
One outside of a remote province of Afghanistan. He insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to get to school and was distracted by his father.
My mother was a teacher.
This is it.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my dad -- you see here -- the first one in his family that ever received an education.
For him, it was always obvious that his kids were going to get education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risk.
He saw it as a much bigger risk to send his kids to school.
I still know that in the years, I was so frustrated in the Taliban sometimes, by the time of our lives, by the continuous fear and the perspective of immission.
I was so good to give up, but my dad said, "Tin-daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing that you're going to stay, which is what's in here. And even if we have to pay your blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed over decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have a higher degree than the Sekist degree, and if my family didn't have used so much for my education, I would have been one of these women.
Instead, I stand here today as a proudly Palestinian of the Middle England College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was released from his family because he missed his daughters to go to school, one of the first was to congratulate me.
He's not just paying a graduate degree, but also for me, the first woman I was, and he's the one who runs through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has a bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start the idea that we could build SOLA, and maybe even the only internal for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to experience great ambition for all of them to feel their most prolific chance.
And to see how their parents and fathers stand for them, as my parents were then, despite all the perseverance.
As Ahmed Ahmed. This is not really his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and they're dead through a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone ranged and a voice would give him a voice when he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
And he said, "Look, if you want me now, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the game because of your old-trenching and pre-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often prevented in the West: behind most of us, the success, the woman who recognizes the value of his daughter and realizes that their success is also your success.
Now, that's not to say that our mothers don't have a big role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are widely aware of the most powerful and compelling future of their daughters' future, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely unrelable.
And on the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
Nowadays, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be looking like America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the lengths, and they're changing with the flow of the U.S. groups.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them to encourage them, I'm seeing a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan for me is a country of hope and the unconconnected possibilities, and it reminds me of the girls every day that go to the SOLA.
Just as I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as a profession -- my life -- was shaped by work seven years ago in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977, I look young, but I don't -- -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to projects with the technical collaboration with Africa.
I worked for an Italian NGOO, and I made every single project we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years, thought we're a good one, great, good job in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we measured.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book in Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias, how to grow food.
We came to the Peru-South Sea-Six, in this fringe valley that leads to Sambesi River. We taught the local communities to grow the Italian tomato sauce and mchini.
Of course, the local people had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came to the table.
And we were surprised by the fact that there was no such a fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God you for being here!"
"Mossal time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-smilled tomatoes. In Italy, they became so large in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Sambins said, "Look, just as agriculture is."
When the tomato bubble was red, about 200 pats of corn came from the river and everything was happening overnight.
We said to the Sambins, "Oh God, the nilperper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great at Italy, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the English world did, what the French did, and after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We at least fed the pine.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we don't have to have the most profound African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid Aid of Dambisa Moyo, she's a Cbian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given a trillion trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what that money has done.
Just read your book.
Take a African-in-year-old reading about what we've done.
We are Western people, colonialists, missionaries, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we hypnotize them, or we are patriarchists.
Both words come from the Latin root, which means "fater," which means "deather."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I'm treating every other culture than they're my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronisination: I'm saving every other culture than they're my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bung Innovation, head.
I was greeted when I read the book "Salls for Beautiful" of Shum. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, they leave you alone.
This was the first principle of the help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This conference today, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and he said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just respond to people and invented a system called the company fund that never started to be motivated, but you're going to be motivated to get the local talent of local people who have the trauma to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you sit with the local community.
We're not working on offices.
We meet in cafeteria. We meet in kelips.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to close with a friend's friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone an idea.
Now, if that person doesn't like what you're doing?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why not come to a community rather than to say to the people what they should do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Entrepreneurs never have a part of it, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
So programming has a light spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be a public meeting.
We're working on one to do that, and we have to be made to a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the hospital hospital of the company, the hospital of the company who sits in your house with you in your kitchen table, helps you find the tools to help you to change your passion in a way that makes life worthwhile.
I tried this in the Esperance, West Australia.
I was a doctor who was now trying to escape the disengrous, where we say others what to do.
And so I walked through the street in the first year, and I had my first three days of my first clients. I helped him out in a garage, he was Maori, and I helped him to sell him to a restaurant in Perth, and then we went to the fishermen, and they said, "You brought the Maori Can help us?" Can you help us help us?"
I helped these five fish, and I worked together, and I couldn't sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents of Chicago, but I was also on Sushi for about 15 dollars sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them do this. Can you help us?"
In one year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk> Why?" I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I'm holding their mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- -- So the government says, "Let's try it again."
We've made it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've been helping 40,000 companies build this way.
There's a new generation of companies that go on loneliness.
Peter, one of the best corporate CEOs in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's mathematical professor, when he was working on companies, and Peter says, programming is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So programming is the death of entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch to not know what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with her money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get you to get to one.
You have to offer them discretionion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get discrete.
In a community of 10,000 people, we're getting 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who have the intelligence and the passion?
Now, for the one of you who are most applaudably applaudably in this morning?
"Sothing, passionate people. You applaud this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the deficible fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing, and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn machine is not sustainable.
The open-off of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, re-use, transport, and share with them.
The technologies that exist for this are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Are universities? Forget it!
Governments? Forget it!
You're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to discuss the future of the city in New York in 18600.
In 1860, they came together and they were speculated, and they were speculated, and they were going to happen in the city of New York, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows at the same rate, they needed six million horses to get people to, and it's not possible to get the crap done at six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
In fact, 1860s, they see the dirty technology that's spreading the life of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
So the idea of finding another technology was the race. There were little tiny factories in the backlands.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, they have to be offered to them with discontion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
and then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest company to the biggest company, all of them have to do is to do three things: to sell the product that has to be grand, the market market market has to be grand, and the financial accounting needs to be enormous.
You guess what?
We never met a single person who can make something that would work at the same time, sell and save money.
This is not something that exists.
This person was never born.
We've done research and we've looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have been common, just one: none of them were founded by one person.
Now, we teach 16 year-old graduates in Northland entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransian Autography. The job is 16-year-old, it's in the first two pages of Richard Bransansian Autoir, how often he uses the word "us" and how often the word "we" is."
Never "ich" and 32 times "we."
It wasn't alone when he started.
No one started a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where a community in which a group of developers have a small background in cafeteria and Bars, and they're dedicated to their partner, who are going to do what someone of this gentleman who's doing about this gentleman who speaks about this epist, and someone tells you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to your money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate organization to help them find the tools and people, and we've found that the wonders of the local population, that culture and the economy can change the culture of this community, only by the one of the passion, the energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it needs to be Alice in the miracles country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communication -- to challenge educational education in communication.
I was scared.
Real fear. Fear before these students with their large brains and their large books and their large, I don't trust my familiar words.
But when the conversation began to work, it took me like Alice, when she was pumping down to the taper's wing, and he saw a door on a completely new world.
And I also felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed by the idea that they had and wanted to see that other miracle land.
I think to open up these towers, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know anything about it, it's not going to move forward. I think it's not our responsibility as a non-religious, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please, bear with us.
So I want to show you a couple of ways that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, okay?
Tell us why our scientific field is so relevant to us.
It's not just to tell us that their chids are being studied, but it also tells us that their chids, their pids, their little-like structure in our bones, are being important because it's important to understand osteoposis and treat.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to have any kind of syllgy.
Now, the technical term is a obstacle to understanding your mind.
Now, surely you could use your "pit and time" and time-to-time, but why don't you just say space and time," which is a much more obvious thing for us?
We're not just about to make our thoughts understand, it's not the same as to distract your level.
As Einstein said earlier, "Don't do things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can tell us something about your scientific field without having to compromise any kind of policy.
Now, a couple of things are about this. I think, examples of stories and analogies. In this way, you can pull us into your hunge.
And if you present your work, let's throw the spots away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "the point?"
What happens when someone else is going to be cut, and with these dots, the first one to your audience.
Now, the slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the conversation about our brain, and that's how we're being challenged quickly.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the feather is so robust that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, easy sentence to use, to the audience, if it's a little bit of a thread, it's going to lose, it's using images and graphs that are also going to respond to our other senses and create a deeper understanding of what you describe.
These are just a couple of ways that help us open up these towers and see the wonderland that science and technology are already coming in.
because the engineers I've been teaching have taught me to connect with the <unk>N"N" in me, I want to sum up everything with an equation.
Look at your science details and your writing words, they divide through the popularity, so the audience is important, and they multiply the whole thing you have with your passion that you have incredible work, and that's the most sophisticated interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you have solved this equation, I'm very committed to myself.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can actually film a crime in Syria with a cell phone.
You can tweet a message and launch a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a song with a cell phone, you can take it up on the sound cloud and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in the time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street for changes and demonstrated them.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all of these people who are coming out of this and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up!
Hold it up. Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot of them. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how my life has changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Pumping data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. embassy has set up a policy line.
This is a policy line called the U.S. Food Council.
The rule is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service provider in the entire Europe, has to store a range of users' information.
Who calls? Who is going to send an email?
Who is sending a text?
And when you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And all over Europe, people are up and said, "We don't want to do that."
They said, we don't want this kind of water supply to this.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, and they all said, "We don't want to do that."
And here you can see, like tens of thousands of people migrated on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Funity instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be called the Walk 2.0.
The Stasi was the headblimp police in Eastern Eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is it really going to work?
Can it really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Wired Telegraph, who was the biggest telephone company in Germany at the time, and I asked them, please, send all the information you've stored on me.
And I asked her once, and she said, "I didn't get a right answer, just a squatter Bla."
But then I told myself, I want to have this information because it's my life that's tracking its protocol.
So I decided to put a court process on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telegraph said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And it was at the end of it as a comparison.
I'm going to go back to the counterage for which they all demanded information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court chose the introduction of E.U.R. line was a German law enforcement proposition.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And it was on the CD.
35830 lines of information.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My drive.
But then I realized for a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life on this date.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm asleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make it published.
Because I want to show people what the U.S. Security Council means.
So with time and online data town, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in, you can go ahead and go back.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt to K<unk>nn, and how many calls I walk along.
All of this is possible by this information.
It's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I call my wife and she calls me up, and we're talking a few times.
And then a few friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you up, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything you can see.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who you're talking to who you're talking to who you're sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months, in Europe, to two years.
As I said at the beginning, let's imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, there were cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi had known who was doing this demonstration, and if the diverber had known who the leader had been, that would have never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And then, of course, not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so many information as they can get over us, online and online.
They want the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, you say your congressive, just because companies and government places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for information they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central. The spiral stores, rapid restaurants, Brakau spaces.
So the city planers come and they changed the name of South Central Africa, so it was about something else, they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that was changing something that was wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Siledom stores, rapid restaurants, Brakau Plains.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivehrus and the Drivebysys.
The thing is, the urge to kill more people than the urge-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles from the most unpredictable diseases.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't see that anymore.
And I wondered how you felt if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, you see the negative effects of the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I've made sure that chairs buy and sell as a power route.
I see a lot of dialogy centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that this must stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I also didn't feel like a little over 45 minutes of a year-old, to get an apple that's not under the pesticide.
So I planted a food hot air from my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the parking lot.
It's 45 feet. It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care about it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay in the place."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grass, and we started to plant my food and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of pre-material group, put together by all the social layers and from all the city, and it's all voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else complained.
The city came up to me, and he made me basically a station, and he said that I needed to remove my garden, which was a propulsion to a rifle.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
A set of rules for growing food on a piece of land that doesn't matter to you?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her T with it."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times received wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and he spoke to the city of Green Ground Ground, and she was a member of Green Ground Ground Ground, and she was basically a petition on Change.org, and with 900 frames of it, we were successful.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My town even called it, and said that they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why don't they do that?
L.A. has the largest hardware room in the United States in the country.
They have 4,4 kilometers of hardware.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato sauce.
Why the hell shouldn't you find that well?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 thousand -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my empowerment message, and I'm telling people to make their own food grow.
To build your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more ashamed to be part of this preconventional reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Patherwork is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's leaning on walls, I'm shaking lawns and air plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my supings for this stuff.
You might be surprised what the ground is all about if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
You might be wondering how children are affected by this.
So gardening is the most therapeutic and the most powerful act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can get strawberries.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in the night. They were in my backyard, and I came out, and they looked like this.
I was really miserable because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason for the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that made me just the most powerful to do that. People told me, "Fin, you're not afraid you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "On God, no, I'm not afraid they're going to blow up.
And it's also on the street.
So that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time I want them to take their health back."
And then, on the other hand, I put a garden in this homeless house in D.A.
These are the guys who helped me get the truck to run the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted their mother and her grandmother, and it was really amazing to see how it changed, even if it was just for a moment.
Green Grounds have already planted about 20 gardens.
and we went to our mubial stations, and we got about 50 people and we did all of these volunteers.
When you grow carbon, children eat carbon dioxide.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get any of them, if they're not shown, how food and body influence them, they're blinding them, whatever you're talking about.
I see young people who want to work, but they're sitting in this thing -- I see color kids that are just on the path that they're looking for, and it's not going to be anywhere else.
The garden gardeners, I see as an opportunity to train these children to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole residential block in gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscont and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, you don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The thing about sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and getting them to experience the joy and the pride and the honor that you build your own food when you open up farmers.
So, what I'm trying to do here is make this sexy.
I want to be the green rebel, the gang, the gangiest garden.
We have to turn the image of the hallway.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gang.
You're going to have to start with a chim, right?
And let's have the weapon to be your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up if you want to sit in a more noisy chairs and make a meeting where you're talking about doing some clothes.
If you want to meet me, come with your kel, in my backyard so that we can plant some pudry.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford English dictionary is "snnollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And it's "nollygoster" means "a-free politician."
Although a newspaper publisher took a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who stands out of a court, no matter of side, program or protocol, and his success on the pure power of the monumental declaration."
I have no idea what a paper is.
I think something like that, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for example, the British Parliament were not allowed to release newspapers the exact same word of debugging the debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with this extraordinary name called Brrosby, who was on the parliament.
They threw it to the Tower of London, and he was brave, but he was brave enough to get there, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so believe in the distribution of Brassus." A lot of people think.
Brassuts are about the English word for a tin.
But that's not true. It's going back to a leading violation of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States, at the time when it's just gone independence.
You'd look at the question of how to call George Washington, the state of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a straight national nation?
and it was reported almost a long time ago about Congress.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-rurity George Washington, and again, the protection of the people in the United States, the people of Washington.
It's not that disturbing.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was approved.
They were not monarchists, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked. It could have worked.
But everybody was bored in a little bit, because this debate had three weeks of paper.
I read the days of a Senate that's always written: "Take the same topic."
The reason why the delay was so boredom was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The one who wanted to do this was not to be a choreographer that Washington Ligier did. They didn't want to be him.
And the kings, and maybe it's also on ideas of his own,
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most vulnerable title they could think of.
This title was "Pisording."
President. They didn't invented the title. He existed before, but it only meant someone was pre-connected.
It's something like the preconcession of a jury.
He didn't have the size anymore than the term "Dear" or "Dearch water."
Sometimes there were little colonial groups and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
And so the Senate refused to give him a second.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy needs to sign up treaty and make foreign-changer.
Who's going to take it seriously when he has a stupid little title like the president of the United States of America?"
And then, after three weeks, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, you're not going to use the title of "isis" in front of the day, but they absolutely didn't want to make sense that they were not meant to be responsible for the opinions of the nations, whether it's in the Republic or the monarchy, where it's the state of the state itself unrelable, not the end-to-truthessable, the world, the people who are not the people who are not meant to do
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One, and I think it's the best thing to do -- and so far I can't figure out whether the Senate ever has been formalized the title of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, she just celebrated the title. He just waving for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government tells you that something is temporary -- you're going to wait 2233 years later.
And third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not so humorous, right?
It's something that has to do with something more than 5,000 nucleic swamps that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drone and all that stuff.
and the truth is, and the story has given the title of size.
And that's how the Senate ended up.
They have a respectable title.
And the other concern that the Senate is about self-expression -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations do you know a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost, because no one feels humble when you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take with, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the way that the word changes much more than words can ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck about 50 rugs on the fight to the Mr. Dealalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfing from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would love my black Conconial gloves against a pair of brown leatheres and a rocket in a direction of the government-fubricity that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been around the war a long time since, but besides Pyjama parties and football game on Samschps and he fought with racist-state groups and outsient ideic protesters who lived with communism and Afghanistan and Violence for a long time, and also pushing the evidence before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I think, a lot of people who are called Afghans, South nations of God's Gads. An atheist, and a radically political artist who has been working last nine years in Afghanistan, and he's created.
So, there's a lot of amazing things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainworms. I want to make art that makes it mixed and trust and communicate and rewrite reality and even the kind of creative people to try and understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day of a jihad -- wagging the jihad against communists like <unk>Sop<unk> blues<unk> and transferred to armed religious and political corruption to enrich itself.
And what else can make jihad-to-the-day than to run for Parliament and have a choice campaign on the slogan: "Please choose me! I'm going to make jihad.
And try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi who spend on national superheri.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Ronging," where you're a police officer, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, giving money and giving them money to the names of Kabul, and they're not going to give them a chance to them, and they hope that the 100 of the United States will take us from Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my view, the Cropian conflict.
The war and the strange view that came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I created a hedge of local Afghan dressers with a brineberry or several or several other in a nebcal fashion.
And I'd like to see how a simple slot of Kabul looks like Kipling Appell from 1899 to create a dialogue about the current development organizations of the developing colonial rhetoric of the White White man to protect himself from the brown man, and maybe even to be a little bit of a civilized civilization.
But for all of these things, you can go to jail, they can't be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
But I do, because I have to, because the geography of self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been working as a model.
It's been said 10 years ago, exactly.
I feel like I'm here in the room, a kind of unconditional tension, because I wouldn't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit more change on that.
This is the first time someone walks up from the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness that you think of.
If a few women were really shooking when I came out, you don't need to tell me this now, I'll read it later on Twitter.
I also recognize that I'm quite privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
And it's not the chance of all of them.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the sweater over my head, because you're all going to wake up, so you don't do anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as uncomfortable as this picture was.
It's powerful, it's also a screenscent.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I actually had never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should throw my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And apart from surgeries or the wrong clones I've been thinking about for the work two days ago, there's only very few ways to change our own utteration, and our utteration -- although it's super-scientific and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being scary to be honest with me is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a lovely white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
Now, I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but I'm going to ask you the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a very important heritage, and maybe you might ask yourself what that legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have no longer defined beauty as healthy and young and primitive on our admiration, we're programmed to be biologically, but also as big, crusty, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's been paid to me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some kind of fashion providers are like, "Haltomi, Tyra, Tyra. Joan Smel."
And first, I'm talking about your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I'm sorry to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student from NYU has counted all the modules on the run, each single one that was being dled, and that in 677700s, only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that's always being asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know, it's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can do everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or the Ninja heart surgeon, which would be completely insane, because if you were the first one."
When they're still saying about this great counting, "No, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "I'm going to say, "Who my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head of American bird cancer or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say, you want to be a model later, like you're saying you want to win the Jackor in the serifet.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of a sophisticated model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be wiped out.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a picture of your work," well, the leg goes first, long, long, long, and this arm goes back to the back, the head is on the side, you move around the side of the page, and just just just go back, and you see, you see, 400, 400, 400, 400,
It looks something like this.
I hope that maybe less weird than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what's happened.
If you finished school and you've made a life cycle and a few jobs, unfortunately you can't say much more. If you say that you want to be president of the United States, but you're looking at life. "10 years of underwater," you'll be looking at weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who are you raising all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much all the photos will be retured, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the very first photo I did, and that was the very first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know this is going to be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
This is how I just saw just a couple of months ago with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this shoot.
My friend had to come and join me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a surfing for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-D magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're constructives, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and their pre-propination and reproduction. I'm not.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You're doing things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-cul gloves I can't carry, except for the things I get free, things I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day, I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and she was streaming over a red light light, and of course it was stopped. It just took a "Sorry, Mr. Words," and we could go on with it.
I've got these costless things about my appearance, and I don't have people who are just there because of their personality, and they're people who are paying for their appearance and not paying a high price to their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 140,000 teenagers who were stopped last year, and was filtered, 85 percent black black and Latino and mostly young men.
They live only 177,000 young black and Latino-American men who are not asking the question, "Am I stopping?"
It's like, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When am I going to quit?"
In my research to this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and this number goes up to 78 percent when they've become 17 percent.
The last question about me is, "How is it that we be a model?"
And I think they'll expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and a glowing hair, then you feel very happy and fabulous."
And we give back days a response that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera I never said before, is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel unsafe because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask, "I'm happier if I had thin legs and darker hair?"
And then you want to meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool little flamade, and they're the ones that look like their appearance are probably the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really difficult to get a real, honest balance, because on the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable to sit here and say, "I got all the benefits from a stack that was being dragged into the comfort." And it doesn't feel very good to refinate." And that's not always making me happy."
It was especially difficult to share a heritage of oppression and race when I'm one of the biggest uses of it.
I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've made this up until 10 or 30 years before I've been past, and my career has been completely disrupted, because I probably wouldn't say how to get my first job, or maybe I might not say how I was paid college, which is so important right now.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our strange failures and failures more.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, leveled Gaddafi, deficiency.
But never get anything like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's now been now almost two years since the monitarian revolution has been shattered by the waves of mass-pancing in both the works and the Egyptian revolution.
I connected myself to many other Libyans, and beyond overseas, to challenge a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadadia.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, licensed women and men stood in the front row, and the end of the regime, the end of the regime, the Slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
They've demonstrated some kind of famous courage by putting on the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity, from far from far to far the distant West, all the way to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 deaths, it made us realize to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
But the Gaddafi has left a huge burden of mine, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation of the course of the path.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrant regime has destroyed both infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of the ly-cia society.
The devastation and the challenges I've known as many other women who are now building civil vyias in Australia, and we demanded a legal and sustained transition to democracy and national acumen.
Near 200 organizations, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis, in Benghazi, started almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exile, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops on the issues of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding of Liby women, a movement of women, leaders of various different forms of life, whose goal is to be public for the sociological empowerment of women, and to embrace our right-being in democracy and democracy.
When I first started a system where I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I was awarding a leadership platform for the Peaceican women to reach a vote-contactive law that would give every citizen, no matter what context to choose and vote, and especially to provide political parties between male and female-central and vertical-level, and to make a constant amount of a difference.
and we ended up being taken over our initiative and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nationwide population since 52 years of the first elections.
But slowly, the euphorian of the elections and the entire revolution, because every day we started to have new news on violence.
One morning, we entered the news of the Middle Ages, Arab mosques and Sufi leaders.
In another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to the message.
After another morning, the suicide bombers were reported by the army.
And indeed, every day, we're facing the rule of licensing and their ongoing events against human trafficking and their misguuruation of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mental capacity, polarized and distant from the ideals and principles, liberty, dignity, social justice, the one they thought they were.
Intent, rejection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you to inspire the success story of our disclosing and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, have made the false choices and the wrong choices.
We have answered our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the hardest and change between women and male candidate peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why is our society going to continue to polarize and dominate self-confident politics of dominance and endurance, both men and women as well?
Maybe the women were not the only one that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the gade and the unchanged.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus that's needed to make the elections that have ultimately empowered the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of the anger and demand a day to make a shower.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gade.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only does the values, but also to argue that Gade instead of revenge, cooperation instead of a competition, rather than a lack of competition.
These are the ideals that need a war of rusty lasia desperately to get peace.
Because the peace has an alchemia and in this alchemie, it's about the cross-cading of feminine and masks of view.
It's the real maneuver.
And we have to do that in some ways that we have to do before we do sociopolitical economics.
After a stop from the Koran, "Salam" -- peace, "is the word of the beautiful God, slush."
The word "raemem" again, which is known in all the latehamian traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rail" -- and symbolized female feminine, the whole humanity, the man's and the female's female, all of the tribes and all the peoples have gone.
Just like the mother's mother's juno, which grows in his body, is so much more than the basic whisper of compassion, the existence.
And so we said, "My Godlless always give things."
And so we said, "My Gadeade has pre-decided with my fortune."
Let's be the case of the goquade to all of us.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In the school, we're doing the story of Kim Il's history, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Even though I was thinking about what the outside world was, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea until all of this changing time.
When I was seven years old, I saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer hunger myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from my sister's sister's sister.
And it said, "If you're standing here, our five family members will not be more of the world, because we've been eating nothing since two weeks.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about people who were dying in my country for the first time.
Shortly after I went over the railway, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A squad drowned woman on the ground, and a pighse child in her arm looked in her arm smelled helplessly helpless in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they're all busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'9s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans liked the famine to sacrifice, and many more survived because they ate grass, beetles and celpine.
Luge accidents became increasingly increasingly, so at night, it was all drifting away from China's lights on the other side of the web where we lived.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image from North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Ampont, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vigorous and enabled North Koreans to escape.
Many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies drive through the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can tell you that while I was sent to the devastating years of famine to the relatives of South China.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it took 14 years to work again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be like North Korean refugees, but soon I learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal migrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare dream was recognized when I was caught by the Chinese police department and was sent to the police station.
Somebody accused me to be Northern Korean man, so they tested my Chinese convictions and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid of this, and I thought my heart was going to explode.
So if you have anything unnatural, I could be locked and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made it to control my emotions, and I answered the questions.
After they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "That was a false failure.
It's not a Northstore."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are getting messages from foreign protein, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police and they're released.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they're caught, they were finally released by enormous international pressures.
These North Koreans have not been so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China, and they're already released to North Korea, where they're tortured, imprisoned or publicly executed.
Even though I had been able to escape happiness, many other North Koreans don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
and after learning a new language and work, their world can be replicated in a moment on its head.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was moved to South Korea, and I was a bigger challenge than I thought I had thought.
English was so important in South Korea, that I had to start my third language.
And I also learned the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very divergent, because of 67 years of the division.
I went through a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstore's grandmother?
How am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country more than my home could have been.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't get easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording test at the university.
Just as I became more normal about my new life, I got an shocking call.
The North Korean authorities started taking the money I was sending my family, and as punishment, my family forced to move around, to a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to the freedom of the road.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and made me go to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them to more than 2,000 miles in China, and then Southeast Asia.
The bus drive lasted a week, and we've been caught almost several times.
Once, when the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the exact amount of everything, and he started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I decided to stand up and told him that they were cursors, and I was her bosses.
He looked at me, and he was looking at me, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get it to the rough border, but I had to almost lift all my money to the borderline of Laos's border.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border transgression.
After spending money and drinking money, my family was released within a month, but only for a month, my family was rebelted back into the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest revelations of my life.
I had done everything to protect my family to freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested, just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went and I went across the immigrant agency and the police department, trying to free my family, but I had not had enough money to pay back to cash or money.
I lost all my hope.
And the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger cares about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and not to complain about a bank engine, and I paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about all the heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
And I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The earlier foreign strangers described to me a new hope that needs the North Koreans so desperately, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I've been united again in southern Korea, but to gain the freedom is just one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn to learn in education, to learn English, to learn the professional education and to do a lot more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family care, and we're sending them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make hopeful North Koreans to succeed with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
He's sharing it in a way that he's not making it away.
It's not lousy. It's not on the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to be about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of a thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It's absolutely unknowing memory.
It also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate fridge, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, when the first consequence of the teombas was to have had my arm on my arm to have stolen and Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't you hear it so incredible?
Now a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often went over and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul was that, although this was the case, even though they weren't considered a normal one, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- amphibically illist and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compatism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that's affected social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a different way to make it different than each individual, and it's called Remi as far as Sam.
And the world's been discovered in a new person of autism for every 20 minutes, and although it's one of the fastest growing diseases in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm living with autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And I realized, after a few months, that it was different.
He was a lot of a lot of a wombish.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived in his own world, with his own set of rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a row, to fit the washing machine and eat everything that came through it.
And when he was older, it became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the ravain and the Franes and the never end of hyperactivity, something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human, who never had never been done.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normalality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only tell you a thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift to each of us, and all of us have a gift, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifices of potential.
The opportunity to scale, progress and change die at the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edveron has been enjoying us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph on a project that's been harvested a apple and a human-lived radiation era only by one millionth.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femtoto-to-Mill photographer, a new technique that is so fast that it can make time-time sculptures of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are beyond our view of view to look outside corners or without any <unk>-ray image in our bodies and really ask what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I take it to a billionth of a second, and I zoom it in a billionth of a second -- that's several extra-seconds -- I'm creating a package of photons that's hardly a thin, and this photon-taper, this project, that's moving at speed, and as I said, a million times faster than a normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photons package, and you put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's the way the light looks like slow motion?
So, this whole event --
So, think about this, this whole event actually takes less than a nanoscopic -- so long as it takes the light to take back this route -- but I'm trying to slow this video to the factor 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon dish that starts to move through it, and that eventually breaks inside.
Now part of the light comes from the table to the outside, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the cycle of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's streaming around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection from the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and you take it back the same route, and you slow the video back to 10 billion times, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
One day, a week? No, a year.
This would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about something still-lapse photography?
You can see again, like this wave of the table, the Tomber and the wall on the background.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature would paint this picture, each time, a Femto image, but of course our eye looks a collection of images.
But if you look at these Toms, you'll see that when the light blows the Tom's lights, it's going to keep it all back. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomrow is mature, and the light jumps in your way, and it's coming back after a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto-to-Mamera is built in your Cameroony, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if an fruit is a stable, not to touch it.
So how did my team at MIT have built this camera?
Now, when a photographer, you know, if you're doing a photo with a short amount of air time, you've got very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than your shortest air time, so you're getting the same light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons-program, and we're drawing it back and forth with very clever synchrony synchrony, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make these femem-tem videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future supercomputer: see corners?
The idea is that we're going to turn some light on the door.
It's going to be crushing into the space, a part of it, and it's going to bounce back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use this multi-fold-through the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've already made it.
On the left side, you see our Femto-Mamera.
Behind the wall is hidden and we're going to throw the light on the door.
After our paper was published in theNature Communications, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to chop up this light project, and they're going to put it back on this wall, and these photons are all being all in the open directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then break the light, and then then again, a part of the lights of the light, and then reflect a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but it's going to be quite interesting at the most interesting time
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It's got a very good time-solving, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, because of that, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is to which distance is.
So by lighting a laser, we can take a raw image that -- you can see it on the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we can put them together and try to analyze the different light walls, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is the reconstruction.
We've got a little bit to do before we can do this in the lab in practice, we could build cars that can't avoid and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous leaks, by looking at light, by looking at the window, or we can build final routes that can see deep down the body in the right, and also see the sandscopes around the sand.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, and that's why this is really a wake-up call for scientists, now we can think about Fto-M photographer, because a new imaging process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as a matter of a matter, even a scientist, is a science that has become a art of the ultra-stopic photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data we're using, not just a scientific sequence. We can do a new form of computer photonaporphic photography, with paint, with paint, and then we can't look at all of those lightbulps and light, and we can't even look at all of those
But it's something that happens here.
If you look under the glass of the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we, because we're almost recording in the speed of light, we've had some strange effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly familiar.
So the sequence that happens in the world's events appear in a light sequence, so you can use the relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So no matter whether to focus on photography or to make a new imaging tool for medicine or new exhibitions since we've been able to open all the data and hope that the "filder" is the creative and the research community that we need to stop to stop from the megale to the megale to the corner -- to start with the next dimension, to get us to step on the next scale, to the next-to-to-to-to-to-to-
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our people can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many wisdom promises are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like a sticker and aphids and crosses.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent is paying my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant houses so that our communities have reflected our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is choked by the vast eel that's been woven to hundreds of years of people who have been in love with drunk and trauma, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most abandoned land in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I could get it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me, and her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I've been able to feel a great gratitude for my life, and it's been just a lot of clarity about the things that I think are important to me in life now.
But it's hard for me to keep this view of time on every day.
It's easy to lose your daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard, and I wrote with a bridge of the gaps, "We'll die, I want to die," "I want everybody who can come, take a piece of chalk, think about their life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but I was completely filled the wall the next day, and it grew, and it grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that are written by the people on the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I want to die, I want to be a broadband about the International Trisis line."
"I wish I'm mortal, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm saving a tree." I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die." I want to live sub-control."
"I'd like to die, I'd like to keep it in my arms."
"I wish I'm mortal, I want to be a person of cavace."
"I want to die." I'm going to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of the people brought me to laugh, to the wine, and to the wine, and to the hard times during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and more inclusive way.
It's about creating space for sharing and thinking and remembering what's most important when we grow and changing.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a building boxbox, and now in the world, like Kashstan, South Africa, Australia, Australia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to move up our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think about life as being short and sensitive.
We're often discouraged by talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation to death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The idea of death makes us feel life.
Our common places that are the best important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, can't help people around us to create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in this. I'm involved in a special problem for anyone who's involved in disgusted mathematics is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do today.
And dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're excited about the fact that we're channebling ballast and feathers, as you're going to see in the same way.
There's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities that are, and potentially a fundamental signal that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's are slowly destroying this extraordinary ability, and that's what it does for my pre-downed Jan Abpling that was in his time a ballet injury.
Over the years, we've been doing a lot of progress in the treatment.
And yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the most unhealthy symptom as weakness, killings, scarcity, and others who are living that disease, and so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We have to measure the progressively objective, and ultimately, the only way to really know whether there is cure, if we have a objective measure that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that, for Parkinson's disease and other movements, there's no biomarker, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing that you can do is that this 20-minute test is in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it's never done that.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would make you a little tour of the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't take a high-tech hospital.
It's actually 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurological unit.
So I'm going to try to suggest a non-conventional way that we're trying to achieve this, because we're all, at least, virtual, like my name Janis Start.
This is a video of vibrating vocal rays.
This is what happens in the healthy state, when someone created speech sounds, we can look at the coherent ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we could make the sounds, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP.
And you need a lot of practice like ballet.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it's learning.
By the way we can use the position of vibrating vocalgers, and the way the limbs are also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom record, you can see an example of irregular vocal evidence.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Bad, weakness, cphemity.
The language is even more and more aged and cursive about it, and that's an example of the same thing.
Now, this effects of the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and a direct analysis software, combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, we can now tell where someone is in a radio between disease and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not the non-invasive. The test is the neurologists.
It's not that little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for this.
And both are accurate. And they're not done by the right-interest.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very quick, it's actually 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're a little bit cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
So this amazing goals can be done with this.
We can reduce logically in patients.
Patients don't have to do routine interfaces in the hospital.
We can get objective data from shared observation.
We can do inexpensive mass recruitments for clinical trials, and we can do it for the first time, and we can actually do it for the entire population to be able to do it.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkes for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we're starting to launch Parkinson's disease-sitative.
With Aculab and patient TV, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data to allow the potential of these goals.
We have a quadage that is available to the world three-quarters of a billion people.
Anyone with no Parkinson's, can call cheaply for a few cents to pass, and I'll say that we've already accomplished six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of it, say, do you take 10,000 people, can you tell who's healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happening is that the patient has to tell you that this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them might not be able to end up.
But we collect a huge database, in many different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we're wired to make it, to understand what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
Right now, your 86 percent accuracy is the same?
It's much better.
My students, Thanasis -- I have to give him a little bit of money, because he's done such amazing work -- has now shown that it's working on the cellular network, which is what makes this project possible, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a little bit improvement.
That is, people can call the phone, and people can call the phone and use the test. People with Parkinson's disease can send their voice to the disease so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the south edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You can see my father's cows behind the back of the kitchen, and that's the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the south, in a small fashion, and that means that wildlife animals like Zebras can't get out of the park any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believes that we came together with our animals and the habitat of the sky, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I learned lions as a child, as a child,
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our ancestors. They are also responsible for this problem.
They kill lions.
This is one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years of his father's blood, and that's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but it's helping the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't have me. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I'd be next to the cow's cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You'll come, you'll see the bird's fish and you'll go back. Next time, but they come, and they'll say, the thing doesn't move, that's still there.
And they're reaching to it and killing our livestock.
One night, I would throw the stone. I would walk around with a torch, and this time the lions didn't catch.
And the way that lions fear light is moving.
I had an idea.
I was working all day as a little boy, and I even took the new radio from my mother, and the day, she taught me almost everything about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a power-panger from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn your left or left or left. It's blinking.
And I made a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little bottle of a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is the battery that provides the battery that provides electricity to the grid. I call it a transactive generator.
And the driver's safety is flashing.
You can see that the sighels are outwards, because of where the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights fluff and lions believe I'm walking around the floor, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and since then, we have no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're actually doing pretty well.
Now, my idea is now used in Kenya, for other predators like hymen and leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms from farms.
My invention helped me a grant to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helps donations and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights in the world where there is no one, and I'm showing the people how to use it.
One year ago, I was just a boy from the savanna who was eating his father's cows, and I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one!"
And here I am.
I was invited to create a plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to do it. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can do it together, side by side, with lions, without any argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n<unk>. In my language, that means, "I thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you hear.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one to the list?
So my next invention, now, is I working on an electric fence. An electroconce fence?
Yes, I know that electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- -- yeah, I tried it a little bit, but I tried to give it back because I got -- I got a blow.
All right, it's hard. Richard Turder, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you each step of your house, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I've been old enough to have a camera in your hand, it's photography, but I'm going to share with you my personal experience, but today I'm going to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of executive, no style, no chance to shoot a picture, not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story starts as I was on a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture, where I gave my daughter on my first birthday, and we were on the corner of 57 and 5th birthday.
So just a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going --
When my daughter's third birthday came to me, my wife said, "Hey, why do you not go to New York City and do a father's daughter's Day Day stop the ritual?"
And then we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're having a complete stranger's camera.
No one ever said no, and the happiness is never even given to our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred to us.
This one was taken just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what was happening on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a shot moment, or some specific journey.
They're also a way for us to take a week in October, to keep time and change our time and how we are from year to year, not just physically but in everything.
Because while we're always doing the same picture, our perspective changes as time as they're always reaching new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, as they interact with everything it sees and how it sees.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value, and expect it every year to be a little bit younger.
Now, just as one of our trips, we walked around, and suddenly they'd been clawed out of a red bar on a ball of a dolls, where they'd learned to have been a little kid who had never been in the previous day.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old, at exactly this point.
She said that she remembered her heart from her chest when she first saw the store nine years ago.
And now they look in New York City for high schools because they really want to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the conscious way of memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 images, I'm not nearly a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage all of you today to come to the image and ask you not to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
