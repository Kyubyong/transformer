When I was a seven years old, I was born with the old-time-time-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-t-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-t-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
My mother died in the top of the great news, the news of the U.S..
He was very excited about how much of the time, because it was really good to be the news.
He's called "The Day."
I didn't know what my father was so happy, but it was very happy to be very happy.
You can't say, "You're going to go to school."
I'm never going to be here.
One of the work.
The U.S. in India, when I was born, I was born, and I was a young school, and I was a school.
So I'm going to say, I'm going to be married for five years, and my parents who had to be a child who was not working in school.
So we're just going to work in school.
Every day, we could not know how much of them could do.
We're talking about our books in a way, so we're going to be able to get it out of the way to get a fire.
We were in a village in a day, in a small day, in a small village.
It was in the winter, but it was very high, it was very cold.
We knew that we were living in our life, and our parents, our parents.
And after the time, the day, the day, the police had to be a week, because the police soldiers were still getting to the police.
We never never heard about how much of us knew.
Are they going to be aware of us?
Do we know where we live in a country?
But we've got to go to school, but we're not going to go to school.
I was very lucky in a country in the country, and in the time, in the time, in the public community, and they were interested in the same time.
My mother was still more.
A single-time man in the country, he was born with his mother, and he was a woman who was working with his mother, and his mother was a woman.
My mother was a teacher, but he was a teacher.
This is.
Two years ago, she was not working in a house to be a home to school and women.
And my mother -- this is the first thing that my mother had a family in the country.
It was really difficult to be a child who would be a child who would be married, because the women who were still not going to be the most effective ones.
It was like a lot of money in the country, not to get a lot of money.
I know that the age of the day, because of the age of the day, the war, the fear of the violence and the violence of the rest of our lives.
I'm really good to say, "I'm going to say, "You know, you know, you know, you can't see your life.
You can have your money. You can't be in your home.
But one thing is that you're going to see. It's all the food. And when we're going to be able to do with the food, we're going to be able to do with the food.
So, you've got to be willing to get a more?
Today, I'm a seven years old.
I was born in a country, and the years of the years.
Some of them have been a young woman who was born in the prison, and when my parents were working in the country, I'm not sure that my parents had a lot of my family.
Now, I'm going to talk about this, when I'm going to be a professor named K-S-S-S.
When I was born, my mother was born, because the family was born, he was a woman who was trying to give his daughter to the end of the school to the end of the school.
He's not just a little bit of my career, but I'm not just the only woman who was the first thing that I'm going to do with the car, and the car's house.
My family is born.
I've got a lot of the best family, and my own life.
So I'm a global economy for 10 years to be a global country in the country.
So I've got to use the first term, and the only one, the only one, the only one, the only one, the only one, in school, in school, in school, in a school school.
It's very interesting to see how my students work in school, who are really willing to be able to have a lot of their own decisions.
And you see how women and women are going to be a chance to be a lot of their parents, and even as a child, as a result, I'm not going to get the best time.
So the name is not really, and I can't see my son, but I can't see the only woman's friends.
One year, he was a month of his home, and he's going to be a woman in the middle of the United States, and she's going to be able to get a little bit of the rest of the day.
When he was home, he's a kid who's going to have a dog, and he's going to get a kid, and he's going to go back to school, and she's going to work.
And he said, "Well, I'm going to say, I'm not going to be able to do this, but I'm not going to share your own career with the best-term ideas of the world."
So, in the end of the way, I've been thinking about the most of the people who are born in the end of the world, who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a fear.
It's not going to be a good reason to be our best leaders in our own work.
They are often more likely to find the time, and they're going to be a very important story in the world, and they're also a very important way to be in the women who are in the country.
The United States, a lot of people with a young school, because it was too.
Today, in the age of three million children, three million children.
India, who is different than something else.
The Americans are going to be aware of the natural changes.
I don't think that the changes of the world is going to be the rest of the market, and the people who are getting the rest of the market.
But when I'm in the school, I'm going to see the kids who are in my own school, and I'm going to find their own career, and I'm going to find a lot of the time.
One of the country, and the best hope that I've ever been told you, and the best thing that I've been told you, the kids who are going to be the best day.
And they're really good.
Thank you.
All right, I've been working with my life -- a lot of my life in the country in India.
In 1974, I'm a woman -- I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not a lot of the media in the U.S.S. I'm not a lot of the media in the world, and I'm working with the media of the media and the media.
I was a professor who was working on the next time, and we've been able to do the same time that we've done.
I was very interested.
I think we've got to know that women are very good, and women in Africa.
We all got to know what we've done.
Our first project, the first thing I've been to call "The Life" in a way to find a place of the people who were in the city, where people were able to be able to find the food of the food of the city.
We were talking about the U.S. in the U.S. in the U.S. in the U.S., and we've been able to call the violence of the violence and the police and the police and the police.
And the reason that the public had no idea was that we've been working with the work, and they're also working in the way that they're working in the same time.
We were very interested in a way that we were not in a natural climate.
But instead of why they said, "We're not going to be honest, but we're not here."
"F-s"-freating people's people who are going to be able to get the peace."
And in fact, there's a lot of things in Africa.
We had these little-tech weapons. They were so much like the top-time in the U.S.
We couldn't think that, and they're called "The World", like, "It's not like climate."
When the fish were born, they were about about about about about about about the ice, and the water, and all the things that you know.
We said, "Oh, God, God, God, the yoo, the yoo, the God,
And they said, "Well, we've got to have this planet."
"You're not going to say, "You've never heard us."
I thought we were so good in the U.S., but I knew that the women who were in the U.S.S. I met the New York Times, who was what I found in the world.
We're actually looking at the same-fander.
You've got to hear the sound of the sound that we're not going to see the most of the people who don't have the most of the world.
They're going to call the book called "The L-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-D-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t----------
The book was called "The Life."
We've been talking about the largest largest population of the United States.
I'm not going to tell you what the money is.
They're just talking about her book.
You know, a woman who we've seen.
We are in the Arab world, and we're also a group of other people, and there are other people, and we're also a lot of other people who are doing with the same way.
The words are called "The"-f-f-f-f-t-t-t-f-t-t-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
But they have two different different different different different different different.
<unk>t, I'm a different person, as a human person, as I'm like, "I'm very good for you."
L: I'm a different person, when I'm a human person, they're like my own.
This is why people are going to be called "The Life," "The "The English."
I was actually sent to the book "The Life," when I've got to say, "I'm talking about people, because they're not going to have to be able to know, if they're not going to have to be a lot of the problem.
This is the first thing that you should be.
The first thing is to be a responsibility.
Now, the last week, the guy who came to this place, and you know, "How do you have a car in the city, you know, what is the city of a city?"
When I was a young age, I wanted to find people in a way to find a place, and a lot of people who had to have a place in the country, and the people who are not going to be a person who's going to have a person who's going to be a person who's going to be a person who's going to be a person who's going to have to have to be a person who's going to have to have to have
You're doing -- you're going to see the hair.
You've never been a community, you've got to do with the other ideas of the community.
We're not working with a team.
We're going to go in a house. We're in a p-t.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to see the story and what people want to do.
The most important thing is that the passion is.
You can think about someone's idea.
How does this person have to do?
The most important thing is that the person is the most important thing.
The most of the most powerful is the most important thing that the most important thing is.
We're trying to understand these problems, because there's no reason to be a chance.
The idea of this idea is not a problem, but it's not possible.
I had a question that I had to say, "How do we do in the community, and people don't want to do this, but they don't want to do the same way to do with the community?
Let me give you a good response.
There's a problem of the community.
The leaders have never been told, and they're going to be told to do what they're doing. They're doing their own money.
So, this has been a little bit of the time.
The most people who don't know, because you don't know, they're not going to be able to have to be a lot of the most of the people who's going to be working.
We're working with a way to do this, a lot of the resources that have to be a huge change.
A new work is going to be a great work.
This is the hospital of the hospital who is in the hospital, you're going to live in your home, you're going to live in your own family, and you can find a place in your own life.
I've been doing this in the U.S., to do it.
I was trying to get the time back and go back to the rest of the other things that we're trying to do with what they're doing.
So I was just in the first year, and the first day, the first day, the first day, I had to go to the house, and I was going to go to a car, and he was a man, "I'm going to have a car, and he'd have a man, and she's going to have a car, and she's going to have a man."
I'm going to work on these three and working-tech work, and they're not working in a high-tech school in the United States, but they're going to buy a lot of money, but they're going to help me go to school, but they're going to help me to buy the U.S.S.S.
I was in a year, I started working on the market. And they asked me, "How do you do this?"
How do you like -- "I'm going to do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
I'm going to hear the hair and they're going to hear them."
So -- the government says, "You're going to go back."
We have a lot of the world in the countries.
We have 50 million dollars to get to the organization.
There are a new generation of companies who are working on the public.
So, one of the most famous leaders who had been heard about the last year, a few years ago.
So the book was called a study, when he started to have a company, he said, "It's a lot of the public media, and it's a social society in the society."
The death is the most powerful leadership of the leadership.
So you know, you know, you know, you know, what the person who is going to be a person who is going to do with their own person, and they need to do their money.
You have to learn about how you have to do this.
You have to have to be a good problem, and you need to be good. They're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
In a group of people in a year, we're going to take 50 million people.
You see a community of people who have a social and social and the public?
So what you've heard about is the most of you today today?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you have a lot of people.
I want to say that the Internet is really the right thing.
We are the first term of the Second World War, and the climate change -- and the energy that is not the energy that we're not doing.
The dopamine is not a huge amount of energy.
The S-B-S-s-s-s-s-s-nat-nat-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-nve.
We've got to see about 100 billion people in the world, and we can use more than they can use the power of the plants.
The technology is not possible.
Who's going to do this technology for the global media? Who's going to be a good deal?
The government has to say!
It's going to be a company. It's now.
I've been a story in a study in a study in a recent years ago.
There was a group of people who wanted to be the best generation of the world to be a generation of the New York to New York.
In the '80s, they started to go back in the United States, and in the last 20 years, in the U.S.S. in the world, in the last year, in the last year, it was not a new place.
Why did you see the same thing that said, "Well, when the population of the country has to have a lot of money, and it's a lot of money that's going to have to be able to have to have a million people to get a lot of money.
It was always about a little bit.
And they see the whole technology that's happening in the world, the New York Times.
What happened? So, 10 years ago, there was a number of money in the U.S.S. in the U.S.
The idea was to think that there was a lot of information that had to be a lot of water in the water.
Dr. C. John, John.
There's a good choice to work with people.
The first thing that they've got to be a very effective, they're going to be a result.
The most important thing is, and they're talking about you.
The next thing you have to do is they have to be creative and un-term and creative and creative.
They're going to be talking about the leadership of women.
The next thing that we've got to be able to do is that the best thing that you need to do is to be able to have to be able to have to be able to have to be a big amount of the best thing that you need to have to be a product of the market.
You're going to think?
We never have a person to do that, and the same thing that we can do is to do, and to get a lot of money.
That's not something that doesn't happen.
This person has never been born.
We've been doing a research, and we've been able to take the U.S.S. government, the Internet, the Internet, the Internet, the Internet, the Internet, the Internet, the Internet.
There's a really thing that the world who has been used to have a group of the world who has no longer been a person.
So we're going to go to the American American American American School, and we're going to start the first thing that we're doing with the first two-dimensional words, and the first thing that's called "The "The "The "The"" "The "The "The "The"""" is the same thing to be the same-called "The "The" of the word"-to-to-to-to-t-t-
No, no, "A-B-B-B-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
He was not so much.
Nobody had a company. Nobody has no choice.
So we can create a community where the police who are in a high-tech, a small place, and you're going to have a little bit of the people who are doing what you're doing with the iPhone, and you're going to be a woman who's going to be doing with the audience.
What do you do? You can use this?
Okay, so you can pay money to the money?
"Oh, I don't know if you're going to say, "I'm sure you're going to be a kid, you're afraid of you're going to think about that.
We use the same way.
We have a group of people who are working in the market, and they're trying to find people who are able to find the difference between the society, and the people who are able to find the difference between the society, and the relationship between the society.
Thank you.
I've been talking about 10 years ago, it's really going to be a good thing to be to be in the U.S.
The University of the University of the company -- a -- a -- a -- a kind of a business, to use the power of the health.
I was scared.
The most important thing about these students, and they're a lot of their own social and their own friends, they're not talking about their own.
But when the study started to say, "I'd like to get a look at the street, they'd like to get a little bit of the world.
I was just interested with the students who I had to think about the stories that I had to think about the fact that they had to know that they had to know that they had to know that they were in the same way.
I think that the car is hard to make a good work.
We need to create great science and scientists to create the world.
Because our colleagues and scientists are the most important problems that we're going to think about in the future, and when we think about the climate change, and I don't know that, we're not interested in the way that we're not interested in the way that we're not talking about the media.
But these great questions are not really interested with our students, and if we don't know that they're not going to be in the United States.
So scientists and scientists, you're going to go back.
I'm going to show you some of you that you can see how to do this, and you can see that the technology is really important for you.
The first question is, you need to ask you to do this, right?
Now, what's really interesting is that you're going to be talking about this scientific science.
Don't tell us that they're not going to be a sense of the fact that they're going to be able to understand the fact that they're going to be able to understand our own behavior, because we can see that they can't understand their own behavior.
And when you see what they're doing, they're going to be a great, they're going to do,
So, a bit of the way that you're going to think about your mind.
You can actually be able to do this, and they're not really interested in the same time, but why is it that you're not going to do a lot of time and how much of us do?
We're going to understand the idea of how the same thing is, they don't really do the same way to do the same way.
And as a result, "It's not possible to do things like that, but not enough.
You can't have to think about a scientific science about this, not to have to be able to have to have to have to have to be able to have to have to have to have to have to know.
So some of the things that we're talking about is that we can't be able to understand the stories of the way that you can see in your hands.
And when you're doing this, you're going to get the data, you're going to get the numbers.
You're going to ask me, "How is it going to be the word of the "The "The Higgs?"
What happens when someone's going to be a question, who is going to be able to do with the first two people who are doing this, and they're going to show their first first first time.
So, this is just a little bit of the time that I'm not really interested in the process of the process of the way that we're doing in our own way.
So, this example of a lot of the neurologist is very much more powerful, and it's actually a very fascinating thing that the very interesting thing that the design of the design system was that it was actually the very difficult to do with the design.
The right is that the only thing is to be a person to be able to find the same word, because when the people can actually see the same thing that they can do, and then they can actually see the same thing that they can actually do with the same memory of the brain.
So this is a few of us who can help us go back and see the best time, and the best thing that we can see in the world.
The students who I've been talking about this, I've got to make a sense of the way to do with the idea of the design.
So, you're talking about your science, you're going to ask you about the idea of the conversation that you're doing, you're going to do this, you're going to see, you're going to do this, you're going to see, you're going to see, you're a lot of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work.
So, the scientists and scientists, you've got to think about this problem, you've got to be interested in me.
Thank you.
Okay. That's my phone.
A child can be a child and a child.
In a cell phone, you can have a disease in the American War.
You can have a phone and you have a chance to get a message and you're going to go into the high-dimensional and in the city.
And you can take a phone with a piece of a little bit of a little bit of a little-tech, and it's going to be a little bit of the p-f-f-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-D-D-D.
So, this is a cell phone.
I'm a year in India and in England.
So let's go back to the city in this country.
You can see how many people are living in the streets, and they were able to go back to the streets.
We're in the early '90s, and we've got to find these people who have to find the information in the same time, and the patient had to have a cell phone.
Who has a phone in the cell?
You're going to get it up.
You're going to take your phone, you're going to get a little bit.
You're going to get a good, a good, a good, a good, a good, a good, right.
That's a lot. There's a lot of time.
But today, I'm going to talk about my phone and my phone and how it works.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is about 40 million times of information.
C-D-D-D-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
So why are these things?
Because the summer of the summer, the slime mold has a huge amount of the time.
This is the key to the law-t-t-t-t-t-f-t-t-t-f-f-t-t-t-f-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-f-t-t-t-f-s-s-
The key thing that you're going to have to be a car in the United States, in the U.S. in the U.S., a place to create a huge power in the U.S.
Who's going to be a guy who's going to have a friend?
Who's going to be a message?
And if you're a cell, you're in a cell.
So the information is that the information of the next day, for three years, your phone phone or your phone phone.
And in Africa, people who said, "We've got to say, "We're not going to be doing."
They said, "We're not going to have to be able to do this.
We're going to be interested in the future, and we don't want to do the Internet, and we don't want to do the Internet to do this information.
There were some doctors who said, "We're not going to be saying, "We don't want to do that."
And here you see hundreds of people who were born in the streets of the United States, and they said, "No, no, no, no,
And some of them might be able to be able to be a pogy.
The San was the gander of the Southwest in the Southwest.
And I'm like to ask myself, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
Do you really really really do this information?
Every time I've got my cell phone?
So I asked my phone phone, the U.S.S. who was the first time I've been doing the U.S.S. and I've got to do this, and I've got to do this information.
And I asked them, and they didn't know the answer. No one. No one.
But I said, I've got to do this information, because it's because it's because it's the whole thing that it's because it's the water.
So I decided to make a study of the market, because I had to do it.
But the <unk>amp<unk>amp<unk>s, we're not going to do this. We're not going to do this information.
And then, it was a bit more than they're doing.
I've got the pressure to do all the things that they've been trying to do.
Because in the end of the U.S., the U.S. who was trying to be the most popular to the U.S.S. the U.S. was a very good deal with the U.S.
So I had to have this little-f-f-f-f-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-f-
And the thing was that there was a thing.
Two percent of the information in the brain.
First, I was going to say, well, it's a good thing to do, because it's a great thing.
But I realized that, I was a time to do this.
This is six months of my life in my life.
So I've got to do something that I've got to do with this.
Because you see, I'm going to go home, where I'm going to go.
But I said, "Well, I've got to do this information in this way.
I'm going to do it.
Because I want to tell you what the people are going to be called the power of the war.
So, for the time, we've got a data, and I've got this.
This is a series of months of my life.
You can go back and go back and go back and go back and go back.
You can do the same time. I'll try to use.
And you can see how I'm going to go to the KB, and I'm going to get a lot of the food and how many of the cars are doing.
So, the way that we can do is that we can do this information.
It's a little bit of fun.
It's not about me.
It's all about us.
First, I'm going to say, "I'm going to go to my wife and I'm going to talk about a few people.
And then I'm going to give some friends, and they're going to be a group.
And then, a lot of time, you're going to take them and you're going to have a lot of the potential of this.
But you can see people who are more than they are going to be more than they are going to be more than they go to the same time.
You can see all of this stuff.
You can see the number of people who are the group of the group of the group.
If you have to do this, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have to do this, you have to change the society.
This is a building of countries like China and China.
This is a real idea of how you can't know how to be a society, because you're going to know that if you're going to be able to do that, you're going to have to do that information, you've got to do that.
And the information is that the information is going to be more than 40 years.
As I started to say, we've got to look at these people in the world, in the same time, in the same time, in the same time, in their patients.
The guy who had to do was actually have to be the idea of the war, who was the best thing that the government would be ever heard of the government, and that's not the best thing that the government could be.
The New Yorker was never seen.
And not only the most of the pars.
Today, the global economy, so many people can do things, and we can do it, we can do it.
They have to be able to do the future of life, and they want to do everything.
But in a life of life, a life in the world, no one is not a language.
But you have to be able to be a more of the best-term, and today.
They need to be able to be a day.
So if you go home, you're going to tell you that your friends are not a great career, and that's not the most important thing.
You're going to go home, you're not going to go to the government, because the government has to do the problem, and you don't have to do it.
And if you don't think about your phone, you've got to use your phone phone, you've got to do it.
So in the future, if you're going to see your brain, you're going to think that you're going to be able to be able to be able to find the best world in the world.
Thank you.
I live in a South in England.
This is a South Park, the open, the open, the open, the open, the open, the open, the food.
The city of the U.S., he said that he was doing something that he was doing in the United States, where he was doing something like a place in the world, where it was like to be in the Internet.
This is a summer in Chicago.
They're using the high-tech, the pets, the pets, the pets, the pigas.
So, like 10 percent of the countries in the country, I'm in the U.S. in the U.S. in the U.S. and the New York.
The name is that the police of the people who are more than the people who are killed.
They're in a Southwest in New York City,
The American age in my age is about 10 times more than 10 times more than the time, in the age of the year.
I couldn't do that.
And I asked myself how you're going to have to have to have a heart, if you're not going to have to have to have a heart of the water, you're going to have to get the water in the water, you've got to see the water.
I'm sure that the police are going to be used to be used to be used to be used to be a pets.
I see the old-tech, like the police.
And I realized that the need to be there.
I think that's the problem.
The food is the problem, and the problem is the problem.
I didn't have a more more than a more-term deal in the order to get a p-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-f-f-
So I've got a food water in my house.
It's a country that we call the forest.
It's about 10 feet.
The thing is that the city is born.
But you have to have to have to have a lot of money.
So I'm thinking, "I'm going to do that. I'm going to be interested in this, and I'm not going to be interested in the power.
And I decided to go in in the way.
So I've been doing this, and I've been working with the companies, and we've got to work with the food and the food, and the food, the food, the food, the water.
We're a kind of a kind of-tech, all of the things that are working in the world, and we're working on with the food and everything that we're doing.
And the beautiful thing is a beautiful.
But then you're going to have a question.
The city came to me, and I was going to be a bit more, and I realized that I was going to have to be a huge, and I was trying to get a huge amount of the power of the water.
And I thought, "Well, what's really cool?
A lot of a lot of money with the water, you're not going to be able to live with a country?
And I thought, "Well, I've got to do this."
It's not going to be able to go.
The New York Times. He was talking about a talk about the Internet, and she was a professor, and she was a set of the work of the work of the National War, and we were working with a high-tech school, and we were working with a high-tech program.
We had to be in the head of the hands.
My hometown of the city, and she said that they're not doing what they love.
So, why do they do that?
Dr.S. in the United States, the most of the best people in the city.
They're going to have a hundred-foot-foot-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s
This is 20 in the U.S.
This is a huge amount of dollars to reduce the million dollars.
Why would the word be going to be able to know?
The cost of a carbon cell is a number of oxygen.
In the green line, you're going to buy a car and you're going to buy a car and you're going to buy a car in the U.S.
It's my name of me, I'm saying that they're going to be able to make food food.
The food is going to be able to make money as a child.
Look at a university in India.
I've been there. I've got my wife.
And I've been interested with this idea of this relationship, and I've been able to be a different part of my own life, and I've been able to do my own experience.
Look, I'm a artist.
I'm working with my work. I'm doing my art.
It's like a sort of a sort of a pat, the pines, the water, and I'm going to go to the food and the food.
I'm going to see the sun, the water, the plants, the trees, the trees, the water, the water.
They'd be surprised to see what the Earth is going to do when you can do it.
You can't see how much a dark is, and how they're doing people, how they're doing it.
So what happened?
I've seen how to create my own career, and the public community, the way I was working in the city.
The way to do is to change the power of the water.
We're the water.
They'd like to be asked by how children are going to be.
So, the most important thing is that you can see the best time you can see the city in the city.
And you're going to be able to be more effective.
I remember this time, and her mother died, and she was born in the morning, and she was sitting in the night, and she was sitting in the same time.
I was really happy to say, because they were there, and they said, "You're not sure you're not doing that.
The house is not just a place in the street.
I've seen people when I've been scared, and I'm sure that all the people who were so poor, and I'm sure, "You've got to have to have the money, and you've got to have to have the money.
And I said, "I don't know what I'm not afraid of what they don't know.
It's about the street.
So this is a idea.
I want to do it, but I want to say that they're going to be able to get their own money.
And I was working in a room in the hospital, in the hospital, in the hospital, in the hospital.
These are the guys who have to get me to the pander.
It was so good, and they were talking about how they were doing their parents, and how they were doing their mother, and when they were able to see how it was, it was a very difficult way to see how it was.
So, the <unk>11 has been about 10 years.
We've been talking about the rest of the people who are working in the United States, and all of these things are all the work.
When children are hungry, they're going to eat food,
If they eat the food, they eat.
But if they don't know how they don't see the body, how they're not going to eat the body, and how they're doing.
I'm going to work in the world, but I'm going to see these things -- I'm sure that the people who are in the middle of the middle of the audience, and they're not sure that they're not going to be the best thing.
This is what I'm going to do in the world, where we can do this, we can use the families to live in a society.
And if we know what?
We could be the first "The World Life."
But if we're not going to change the planet, we're never going to do.
So this is a kind of thing. I want to do.
I've got to live in the places where people can actually do the same way to see the water.
I want to fly in a car and they're going to be able to buy a car.
So you don't understand me.
I'm not talking about the food, because it's not enough.
The kind of a lot of leadership is that you have to be able to get.
I'm talking about people who are going to go home and the streets and the people who are going to be the best time, and they're going to be able to use the food and the food and the food, and when you're going to get the food and the food.
So what I'm going to do is to be here.
I want to be sure that we're going to be a p-fander, the p-fander, the pets.
We have to see the picture of the mountain.
If you're not a po, you're not a p.
You're going to be a little bit of a py, right?
And you're going to be the heart of your choice.
If you're talking about it, you're not going to be a lot of you, you're not going to go to a place where you're going to go to the Internet, and you're going to go to the Internet.
If you want to go to your hand, you can't get your hand in a water, we can't use it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite examples in the New York Times is called "The Life."
It's like it's so beautiful.
And "The S-f-n" is called "The"-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-n"-f-nil-n."
In the 19th century, a good idea of a human being a better, a good person who is called "The Life" who is a man who is a leader of the war, or the end of the war, the end of the war, the war, the war, the end of the war, the war, the war, the war, the war.
I have no idea what's called "w-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.
And there's words, I think.
But it's very important to say that the word of the world, the way that people know that they're not going to have to understand the language.
In 1977, about the police who had to be the best-called American, not the word of the word of the word of the word of the word.
And the end of the man was actually a man who was talking about the most famous man who was in the American War.
They've been able to go in the New York, and he was a good job, and he was not enough to get a lot of money, and he was so lucky to get the government to work.
And a few years, we've just been able to find the first time to say that the first "The first-called" as many people think about how many people think.
So, in the words of the word of the word word of "to-to-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-
This is not true. It's a conversation to the war of the war, the war of the war.
But I'm going to show you how the social and the most important thing that I want to do is to be a place in the United States, when they're working in the United States.
They heard about the question of how the U.S. who said, "We're going to be the U.S.
You couldn't know.
What is the leader of a civil War?
This is a lot of time in the war, and it's been a long time.
And there were some more of the things that we've got to do.
I'm going to say, "I'd like to call the U.S. and other women, and the women who's women who's women who's the most women who's women's women's country.
It's not a little bit of the way.
Some people would say, "We've got a call."
They thought that's a really clear thing.
They were not a kind of-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d
It could be possible.
But it was a lot of fun because the news thing that he did was, because it took two weeks.
I've been talking about the last book, the whole thing that I've been talking about is "The "The" "The same"
The reason for the end of the time was that the war was that the war was the most effective for the war.
The FBI who didn't want to be able to get a place to do it. They didn't have to do it.
The name, and he's going to do other ideas, and he's going to do other ideas.
They were told the most famousestestestestest, the most famous, the most famous ones that they could be.
This is called "The"-f-f-f-t-t-n."
The name. She didn't know. He didn't know, but he didn't know that he was a guy who was a guy who was a guy who was a guy who was going to have a chance to have a chance to know.
So, like a kind of a p-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
It was not a number of the "The"-f-f-d" or "w-t-t-t-f-f-t-t-f-f-t-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-t-t-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-d"-t-t-t.
There were some great media and international leaders, and it was a very good thing to be a very good thing, but it was a really popular thing.
So the reason that he did was to get it.
They said, "You can't see it." It's not a American name.
This guy has to be a guy who's going to have to have the American American American leaders.
Who's going to be a good thing about the U.S. who is a little bit of the U.S. government in the United States?
And it's just about three weeks ago, the reason that we didn't have to do.
And you're also talking about the word "dve to do it, but they didn't want to be able to understand the fact that they're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to find the fact that the world, not only, but in the world, in the world, in fact, the public community of the world, the people who are not interested with the public and the public community.
You can do two things.
First -- and I'm going to know that I can't have to do this, I don't know that the U.S.S. the U.S.S. the only one of the most of the most of the most of the most of the people who's ever heard.
The President, who's just the only guy who's not going to be able to be able to be the most effective, because the police is going to be the best thing.
The first thing is, if you think about a government, you know, if you're going to have a lot of time, you're going to have a lot of time, you're going to have a lot of time.
The first is that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that the U.S.S. is that the United States, is not going to be a good, or not, is the most important thing that's going to be in the United States.
So it was about a lot of times more than a long-tech, and it's a huge amount of money that's going to do with the world and the world.
The story of the story was called a second.
So the thing that was the end of the end.
They've got a really-veveve heard.
And the other thing that I've been talking about is the kind of the fear of the fear of the war, was it.
But you know, how many Americans have a American?
Seven.
All of them are like to be a little bit like the guy who's going to be on the top of the pets and the pets.
So the end of the end of the war, the war, and the war, no one, no one is not going to be a war, because the United States is going to be the U.S.
And the most important thing is that you can do with you, and I'm going to give you the bill.
And they're also trying to understand the reality of the reality, and the way that the brain can't be the same way that the brain could be different, but also the same way that the brain could be different.
Thank you.
So I was in a high-year-year-year-year-year-old, a lot of time to go to the high-year-old, a high-old, a high-old, a high-old, a p-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
I'm going to see the black-and-and-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-f-f-f-f-f-c-c-f-c-c-c-c-c-f-f-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-f-f
This was the first time I was in India.
I was working on the war, and the war of the war, and the pellon, and the pell, and the war of the war, and the war of the war, the war, the war of the war, the war of the war, the war, the war of the war, the war-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-
But that's the self-ex-t-t-t-t-t-st-t.
So I'm here here, I'm going to be a great, a great, a great, a great, a great, the American American American American, and the most exciting thing that I've been working in the University of the South Africa.
So there are many things that I can't do with, but I don't want to do a lot of things, but I don't think that I'm not going to do the way to do the music and the way that I've been able to find the way to create the relationship between the world, and I'm going to find the way to understand the relationship between the world.
I want to live in a life of a country who has a country who has to be a leader, to be the war of violence, and to be a political, and to the violence of violence.
And what can be a good leader that's going to be a leader for the government, and I'm going to be a leader, and I'm not going to call the public and I'm not a good job.
And I'm trying to use this company to be able to use these who are used to be the U.S.
I'm going to talk about the American American War, and you're going to go to a project called the U.S. to the police, and the police, and the people who are going to be able to be able to get a lot of the money in the United States, and they're not going to be able to get the police, and they're going to be able to get the police and to the police, and they're going to be able to
I'm going to tell you how the war in the country, which is a political war.
The war and the war of the work was to create a new system, a community, a community, a community, a community, a community, a way to create a public, a lot of the most of the people who are in the middle-tech, a high-tech, a high-tech, a high-tech, a lot of the p-tech, a lot of the p-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-
And I'd like to see how a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the gan-fander in the Southwest, and the fact that he's going to be able to find a lot of the fact that he's going to be able to be able to have a very popular, and to be able to be able to be able to have a very famous, to be able to see the fact about the war of the war-
So, all of these things are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of them, they're also going to be able to be able to be honest.
But I'm going to do it because I'm not going to be the power of the power.
This is my favorite. What's your?
Thank you.
My name is a lot of time, and I've been working with the work.
I've been about 10 years ago.
I've always felt that there's a way to actually have a place in the air, because I've never been able to do this.
I've always been talking about something.
This is the first time you're going to talk about the TED TED TED TED, you can see that I'm very happy.
If a lot of women, I'd like to do this, I'd like to say, I've got to get a lot of time to talk about the news.
I'm also interested in a very quickly, and I'm going to show you what I'm going to do in the last 10 years.
I don't have to have a chance.
These are very good, so that I don't want to do it.
The right thing is that the eye is to be in my hand, because you're going to be able to get me back to my head, because it's not going to be a little bit more than my life.
All right.
Why did I have this?
That was a little bit of the time.
So, it wasn't so much of the same picture.
Now, this is a very interesting thing, but it's actually a kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of a bit.
I'm going to be surprised to see that in a few years.
And in this picture -- I've never seen a friend.
I was very happy and I'd like to get my hand and I'd like to get my hair and my hair on the right side of my hair.
And it's been a lot of the most exciting, and I've been talking about the last day, because there's a lot of time to do with the world, because it's a lot of our own, and it's a lot of our own impact, and it's a lot of our own impact.
It's always a bit to be honest to be here.
And I'm going to be here in the top of this, I'm a model.
I'm going to be here because I'm a black woman, and I'm a white woman, and I'm a woman who I call a woman.
So I'm going to ask you the question of people who are going to be interested in the same way.
The first question is, how do you have a model of a product?
I'm like, "I've been thinking about this, but that's not true.
The real thing that I've been a model of a standardist, and a problem in the financial and the most important way that you're talking about this, is that the real thing that you're talking about this.
Now, in the past, we're not just a lot of time, and we're not very happy, and we're not just a lot of the most powerful and more and more than the very high-tech, but also, but also, we're also going to be a very high-tech, but also,
This is a part of me. It's a part of me. It's a part of me.
I know there's a number of people who are now here, and some of them are, some of them, "Oh, I'm sure, "F-A-A-B-B-B-B. <unk>amp. <unk>amp.<unk>amp.<unk>B.<unk>.
And I'm going to show you the data. It's pretty interesting.
But I've got to say that in the year, in the U.S. in the U.S., a very high-tech, that would have been able to have a lot of the time that the number of people who were not killed by the age of the year.
The next question is, I'm going to say, "I'm going to be a product, I'm going to be a standard, if I'm a child?"
And I said, "I don't know that, that's not my responsibility in my own career."
But the answer is, I'm going to say, "Well, this little girl is not like, why?
You know? You can all be done.
You can see the American American or the next one-diving or a "The World Life" or the best thing you could do is, "You're going to be the first thing you're going to do."
If they're talking about this, there's a lot of good news, I'm not going to say, "I'm going to be a doctor, "I'm going to be a doctor."
I don't have a choice, and you can't have to be a leader or a American American American American, or the next-to-to-d-d-d-d-to-d-d-d-to-d-d-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-to-st-st-st-st-st-to-to-st-st-s.
And you're saying, you're going to be a model that you're going to say, "You're going to be able to be able to get the top-dre-d-d-d-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f
You can't do it. It's a great career, and it's not a career.
So I'm going to say about 10 years ago, because the way that the body can't be a lot of time because it's actually going to be able to actually be able to see.
There's a lot of the stuff that's going to be there, and there's a little bit of the way that you're going to see, and you're going to see, and you're going to see, and you're going to see, you're going to see, you're going to see, you're going to see, you're going to see, you're going to see, you're going to see,
It looks like this.
I think that's much more than the middle.
I've been -- it's happened.
If you're a school and you've got a lot of time, you can't have a lot of money, and you can't see, you're not going to say, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to be a great five years of the U.S.
The next question is, "It's going to be a lot of the things that are going to be seen in the same-time-time-up-s-s-s-s-s-to-s-s-s-s-s-s-to-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
And so, all of the things are going to be seen, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first time I did, and I was actually a first time, and I was actually a time I had a time to see the first time.
I'm sure that this is a lot of time, but I'm a young woman.
So I've been able to see a few months ago.
This is the day of the night.
My friend had to be a little bit of my friend.
This is a sort of a few days, a few days, a few days of the American American.
This is a team of the work and the work of the work.
And that's what I'm going to talk today.
And I hope you can't see these pictures.
It's a kind of a group of a group of the people who are with the police and the police and the police and the police and the police and the police and the other one is not the ones.
So the next question is, "You're going to get people like, "How do you do things like to do things?"
Yes, I'm not going to be a few of the high-tech, I can't have to be able to do the things that I've never been doing in the world, but I don't know how to do things.
I was in a school, and I was in a hospital, and I was going to have a food and I had to get a money.
When I was a kid, I was a little girl who was a little bit of a black, and they were surrounded by a p. And we were able to get a look at the end of the mountain, and we were able to get a pum.
I've got these numbers because the difference between the other things, and I'm not just a lot of the people who are not just a lot of their own people, and they're not just a lot of their own choice.
I live in New York, and the U.S. and the most of the people who were born in the last year, and the most women who were born, and women were very young and women.
It's in New York, a few young men who are not very bad, and the most bad men who are not going to be in the end of the American?"
And I'm going to say, "How can I be going to be a child?"
And in my career, I've been talking about this year, that the United States in the United States, and they're not going to be able to be the most effective number of their year.
The last question I'm saying, "How is it a product to be a product?"
And I think they're going to say, "Well, you're going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of stress and you're very good, and you're very happy."
And we're going to give a answer to this question, which is the only thing that you might have to do.
We say, "It's so much so much to be so much more and good, and it's hard to do with people who are interested with people."
That's true. It's only one of the last year, but we're not going to see what I'm not going to be a little bit of the time, and I'm not going to be a little bit of the best thing that I'm not going to see.
And I feel very difficult because I'm going to see the day.
And if you're going to say, "I'm going to have more stress, I'm going to have to have a little blood-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
So you're going to give a few of them a lot of the most powerful, and the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of them are, and they're not going to see the most of the most of the most of them.
I've been talking about this, and I've got to be really hard to find a lot of the time, because I've got to be a very good thing to say, "I'm not really hard to get the work in the way, and I'm not really interested with the whole thing."
It was very difficult to be a failure of the violence of the violence, and when I'm a very successful state of the country, I'm a very high-tech part of the world.
I'm very happy, and I'm going to be here, and I'm really interested in this, and I'm not sure that I'm not going to be a good career, and I'm not sure that I'm not going to be a career, and I'm not going to be a career, and I'm not going to be a career, and I'm not going to be doing this, and I'm not like to be
If you're talking about this talk about this talk, we're going to be able to be able to understand the power of our power and our own, and we're not interested in our own way.
Thank you.
I've never heard the words of the day, the life of life, the man who said, "It's a p-foo-t-t-nil-t-t-t-t-t-nil-t-t-t-t-t-n."
I'm never going to be a little bit like a "The Life."
It's been now two years ago, and the revolution of the war, the power of the state of the state of the state of the state of the war, the war-based and the war.
I've been talking about a lot of other kinds of other people who are working in the middle of the city, and the rest of the world, the way to create a relationship between the war.
And it was a big revolution.
And the young men who were born in the first cases, who were the first time to the first, the first one who had to be the best, the violence of the violence and the violence of the violence.
They've been able to be a study of the war, they've been able to have the violence of the American War.
They have a very powerful impact of the natural, in the West, to look at the south of the South.
And after a time, a half of the years, and a half of the country, and the country, it was a lot of us to find our country and to protect the rest of the country.
But the great thing is that he was a great strategy to the civil War, who has a political strategy for the war.
Two years ago, the social and social and social and social and social, the social culture, the social culture.
The rest of the world and the most important way I've been talking about women, women, women, women, who are so much more women, and they're interested with a political economy, and we've got to have a political impact of violence.
So, in the 20 percent of the time, the time, the police were in the late '80s, in a high-tech, in the '80s.
In the age of the year, I started to find a lot of the things that I started with the social and social and social and social and social skills.
In a young study, I've been a young women who's been working with women's social violence, and it's a social relationship for women who are in the world, and it's a lot of the most important way to be a part of the most important part of the public community.
In the end of the time, I've been very interested with a very complex environment, which is a very difficult way to be a huge impact of the violence of the war.
I was a leader who was talking about women who had to be a leader to be a person who is not a person who is not going to be a person who is not a person who is trying to be a person who is trying to be a person who is not to be a loss of the violence and the fact that the fact that the fact is a difference between the violence and the violence of the violence of the war.
The end of our time was a result of the time, and the war.
Women died in the United States, in the end of the year, in the last year, in the last year.
But it's also a lot of the most important to the public and the public sector, because we're going to be working on the world, because we're going to get to the public school.
We're going to go back to the end of the war and the guerrillas, and they're talking about the most of the most-called-tech and the most of the time.
And one day, we had a message to the American American American War, and the best person who was going to be the best person.
And then, one day, the police soldiers were sent to the police police.
And the same day, we're going to be the most important of the most powerful and their citizens, and their own leaders, their own leaders.
Our culture, a natural state of the war, the political, the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social community, they were interested with the social culture.
And it's a kind of a pic, the pander of the war, the end of the war.
I'm not here today to talk about the most important story of the story of the American government and the government.
I'm still interested in the end of this, we've got to think that the most powerful people who have a good choice to have the wrong choice.
We've got our wrong answers.
Because the war of the war, not to be in the peace or in the war.
Is the flipping of the police and the other men and the men and the violence of the violence and the American War?
No, they don't.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to be a political and political and political and political and political and women, and women are women who are women?
Maybe the women who were not the only thing that was the only thing that the fear of the violence and the violence of the war.
Our society has to be a society and the power of the government, and they've been able to have the fact that the government, the only way that they've been able to have to have the potential to the power of the market.
Our society has to be a society that's more than they're going to be more likely to get the stress, the more likely to get the power of the war.
We're going to be in the middle of the war and the person who is going to be a person who is going to be a person.
We're going to be talking about the word of the word and the word.
We have to have a chance to find the fact that the only reason to do not only be a reason to do, not only to be able to use a way to use the same, not to create a way to create a way to create a way.
This is the most of the war who has to be a war to be a war to protect the peace.
Because the peace of the war, and in this case, it's about the gigus of the gigate and the gigate of the vars of the vars.
This is the real thing.
And we have to do this, we've got to do it.
In a way of a man called "The"" "The God"'s God's God's God's God's God's God's God."
The word "The""'s"-freating" in the world, the most of the most popular people who are in the world, the most of the most of the most of the most of the people who are the most popular, the people who are the most vulnerable to the women who are the most of the most of the most of the most of the people who are the most of the most of the most of the most of the people who's.
And the only thing that the blood mold is so much more than the rest of the heart of the world, the most important thing that the most of the natural power.
So this is what we said, "We've got some things to be a little bit of things."
So this is what we said, "I've got to get a poo-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
All of us all have to be the gogy of the gander.
Thank you.
When I was very different, I was the best thing that I was to be the best part of the world, and I was just talking about the best thing.
And I was very lucky.
In the school, we're talking about the story of the story of the story, but we don't know that women are in the world, and women, in fact, in fact, in fact, there's a lot of the world.
And when I was thinking about how the world was, I thought, I'd like to live in a country where I've been working in a lot of time.
When I was seven years old, I was going to go back to the first time, but I thought, I was in my country.
My family was not a family, and I've never been scared.
In the year, my mother wrote a friend named a friend who was a friend named a friend who was a friend of mine.
And he said, "You're going to see this, that every day, every day, no longer, because we're not going to have two years.
We're all in the body, and we're so sure that we're going to be dead.
I was so angry.
I first saw the first time that people in my country in my country.
I was at the end of the time, and I've been thinking about this, I don't have to do this, I can't do that.
A woman who was in the water, and he was a little flipped in the water, and she was a heart of his mother.
But nobody's not going to be so much more, so they're all interested in their families.
In the 1970s, there was a big country in the South America.
In the end of the country, a half of the U.S., a half of the people who were still getting a lot of the time, and they're also surrounded by the trees, and they're also surrounded by the water.
The more and more of the time that I've never been able to go back to the mountain, where the sun is about the rest of the land, where we're talking about the United States.
I'd like to say, why are we going to do the trees, and we didn't know.
This is a map of the South America, and his mother.
This is the river of the country, and the country is about the country and the South America.
You can see the river, and the very high-tech and the U.S. to be able to be able to get the U.S.
But many people are dying.
I've seen the same air in the air.
I don't know about how many people say, but I'm going to say that I'm going to be able to be able to be able to find the death of the war to the war.
I thought that I was just going to be a long time to be a long time to live my family.
I never knew that it's going to be a long time to work in the world.
In India, it was very difficult to be a young family, not a family.
I didn't have the idea of how the country was, but I'm not sure that it's not very much more than the most of the most of the most of the country, but in fact, in fact, in fact, it's also a lot of the most of the most of the most of the most of the country, but in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, it's not very much of the most of the most of the most
I was in a very high-term sense of my mind, and I would say, you could have to be able to find a lot of my heart-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-
One of my first time, I was born in the country, and I was born by the war of the American soldiers who had to be a police and a police.
He was told me that he was born, who was a country, and they were asked me to ask me, and they were asked me to ask me about the question.
I've never heard that I'd ever seen my heart.
And if someone's been scared, I'm going to be able to be able to be a lot of them.
I thought that the rest of my life, but I was trying to do the memory of the human experiences.
And when they were talking about the work, they said, "It was a group of a group of a group.
It's not a New York."
And they got me. It was a kind of a bit.
Some of them in India, in India, who are still going to be a lot of women who are born, but women are still going to be killed by the police and the police.
So these young men had a good deal.
And they were still surprised, they were also thrown up to the market, because of the international government.
The U.S. the U.S. had no longer.
Every year, in India, in Germany, and in Germany, they're not going to be able to be able to be able to go to the U.S.S., or they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to the city.
I'm still afraid of my career, there's a lot of people in the South America.
It's a very good thing to be a poor, and they're not going to be able to be alive.
And when they're a language, they've been able to find a way of work, and they can see their own experience in the same time.
So, after about 10 years, I decided to go to the country, and I decided to go to the country.
I was a very important challenge for the country, and I thought I could do it.
So, in the U.S. was so important to do that, I wanted to do this, to make my own language.
I've got the most important difference between the South Asia and the Southwest.
We're all in the very small, but we're very excited to be able to be a very different, in the end of the years.
I was a relationship with a culture.
I'm a Southwest or a black-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t?
Who? I'm a? I'm a?
There was no country that could be a day.
Because the most of the time that I've never had to do was not a lot of the time, I had a plan.
I was trying to get the work of the university.
I've been thinking about my life, I've got a lot of my life, and I've got a call.
The Southwest of the money, the family, the family, and my family was a family, and my family was a country to live in the country.
It's so much more than the way that I've been able to do.
The U.S. has to be able to get a lot of time to get their own lives.
It's never been a place of the South Asia and the Southwest, and I've got to go to the Southwest, and I've got to get a place to the Southwest.
Because my family was not going to go to a country, and they had to go to the South Asia, and then in the South Asia.
The house took a few months, and we've got a lot of time.
One time, when the first day, a woman who was a police man who was born in the U.S.
He was looking at the question, and they started thinking about questions.
I was not a family who said, I'd be told me that they're going to be a place.
When the American War was born, I said that she was going to be a woman, and she was told me that she was a hured, and she was a chance to be a fear.
He looked at me, but he didn't know me, but he was scared.
We had to go back to the air, but I've got to get all the money to get the best food to the bestestestestestest to the bestestestestest.
But when we were able to see the only country, my family was surrounded by the most of the time.
So I was a good job, and my family had a country, and my family was working in the country, and my family was working in the city.
This was one of the most of my life.
I had to be able to live with my family, and I was not just working in the end of my family, but I was just just a very good thing to be the only time to the first-time.
I went back and went to the United States, and the police who had to work, and my family had to do not need to buy money, but I had to buy money, but not to buy money.
I've never been so happy.
And I asked the question of the man who said, "What's the guy?"
I was very surprised to be a fear of a poor.
In the English and a journalist, I was trying to go back to the other, and I didn't want to go to the country, and I was trying to get a country to the country to the country, and the women who was working in the United States.
I'm going to be a very happy and saying, "How do you want to do?"
"I'm not going to say, "I'm sorry."
I'm going to be the most people in the Arab people."
I realized that this was a very interesting experience in my life.
The best thing that I've been able to do is that the best way that the world could be a new, the best way that the government could be able to create the best community, and the best community of the country, the best community.
And after the time, my life was a lot of my life, and I was trying to go to the country, but to be a very difficult time to create the right.
A lot of the country are going to be in a country, and they're going to live in a country, and they're not going to be able to buy a lot of money, not to do it.
The community of the community, the best way to do is to be a leader, the best, the best, the best way to do with many and many years.
We can only be able to see the rest of the people in the world, because in the world, because there are a lot of people in the world, because we're going to get the power of the water and the water to do it.
I've been so much more and so much more and more interested in my life, I've been able to find the best thing to be able to get to the U.S.S. government to help help help help help help help help.
I'm sure that there are a lot of time in the world, and there are still a lot of time in the world.
Thank you.
I'm going to give you a little example.
Don't tell you that I'm not a black.
So I'm going to show you a few of my favorite example.
So, it's a very small, very good, very good, very well.
It's not going to be a lot of fun, and it's a way to do with the best way that I could not do.
Lan, who is love.
It's called the flipping, and they're going to be able to get it.
It's not a p. He doesn't have the blood.
He doesn't have to think about the difference between people and other people, and he didn't have a chance to say.
When he's talking about his friends, the words that I've never heard about, I don't know how much it was, and it's a little bit about how the truth is that it's going to be like a little bit about how to say.
He's a big thing. He's very good.
He's a very un-dated memory.
But he's also a huge amount of a pist.
It can't see if my name is not going to be a black-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-d-t-t-t-t-d-t-t-d-d-t-t-d-d-d-d-d-d-m-m-d-d-d-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
Don't they feel so much?
Now, many people don't know.
And in fact, because they're not interested in the human language, they're going to be more likely to think about them, and they're not talking about it.
But what my heart was, and my body was not that, that it was not that, that it was not possible that it was that it was a lot of the fact that it was a lot of the fact that it was a lot of the fact that it was that they were not a lot of the fact that they were not a lot of the same thing.
Now, for example, the way that you're not talking about the stress is that it's a social behavior that's a social behavior, the ability to create the brain, the brain, the language of the brain.
It's actually a lot of people in the other side of the human age, as well as a lot of other people.
And every day, every single day, a human brain has been a human disease, and it's not a huge impact in the world, it's not a huge impact of the world.
And I don't see the first time when I'm a child, I'm not sure I'm not going to be a day.
I was just a few years old, and I was so excited that I was so lucky, and I was so interested in my life.
And then, a few months later, I realized that it was different.
He's very much.
He didn't want to be a little bit of the other people who had so much of the other people who didn't really know.
And in the world, he was born in his own world, and he was able to make the same information that he had to do in the same way that he had to do in the water, and they're trying to get a little bit of the water in the air.
And when he was older, they were different, and they were different.
But the fear of the death and the fear of the war, was not a very complex idea: a lot of the human life that had been seen in the world, a human life, no one who had no idea of the world.
It's true.
Now, I don't know that some of my experiences in my life, in my own life, like I was able to know how they were.
But I'm going to talk about the things that I've been interested with, and I've got to learn about the knowledge of the knowledge that I've been interested with the public and the things that I've been interested with.
The beauty of the natural nature, the differences that we're not aware of us is that we're not aware of a little bit of us.
It's just a different way to do.
And I'm just going to say that I'm going to say, "You know, you're not going to be a good thing to be a good thing to do that.
You can be a very powerful.
It's not a kind of the differences that we have, we have a chance to have a dream. The one is a great thing that's a great thing that's going to be a great experience.
The more energy in the time, and in the end of the time, we're going to think about how to do something else.
You're going to say -- I'm not sure I'm a dead.
Thank you.
So, a little bit of the work with this, and I've been interested with this idea of this project, and it's a piece of time to a second-time, and a second-time line, and it's a second-term picture.
But now, we're going to see a hundred years, and we're not going to see a billion people in the world, but a billion times a year.
I'm going to show you a new kind of a new design that is designed to create a new technology that is possible to create the entire technology that you can actually do in the same time.
And we can use the video to see the same way that we can't see in the brain or in a way, in the lab, in the same way, in my brain, in my brain, in my own way, in my brain, and we can't see what we're doing in my brain.
So I'm going to take a second-dimensional, and it's going to take a second-dimensional, and it's going to be a second-dimensional, and it's a little bit of the data that's going to do, and it's a little bit of the data that's called the entire satellite, and it's a little bit of the data that's called the slime-tech, and it's a little bit of the slime
So, if you've got this project, you can put this piece of this piece of paper and then put it into the fly, and how does this fly in the fly?
How does it look at a different time?
So this is the whole thing --
So you think about this, you've got to do this very long time, so, a lot of time to do this, and you can actually get it up to the data, but you can see the data of the data, but you can see the data of the data.
No, no, no research, that's not done in the research.
So this is what happened in the book, so you're going to see how you're going to see what you see.
The experiment is to take a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a fly, and then the light, the way that it comes to the surface.
The surface of the wall, and you see the wall and you see the light of the light.
A lot of the time that the time, the fly and the weight of the weight.
You can see, there's a light that's a light in the air.
And as the fly comes from the top of the mountain, the top of the top is that you can see the top side of the mountain, and you can see that the number of the images are actually a few of the images.
So if you go to a project, you can do the same time, and then we've got to see the first time, you've got to see what happens, you're going to see what happens in the next few minutes, you've got to see what happens.
One day, a week, a year, a year.
This is a very simple -- a very interesting thing -- a -- a kind of a kind of a piece of a time, a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
And how does it feel like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-s?
You can see the red line, the pars, the p, the p, the p, the p.
It's like a fire in a pade.
It was like this, as a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a light, but it's actually a little bit of the brain.
But if you look at this, you see that the light, you're going to see that the light is not going to be able to see the light of the light.
Why is it? Because the thing is that the light is that it's going to take a look at the surface and then they're going to take it back to the second.
So in the future, if you can actually get this video in your phone, you can't see if you're not going to be able to be a place in a place where you're not going to be able to be able to be a place in a place where you're in a car.
So what was the work of the students in the lab?
So, as you know, if you're looking at a long time, you've got to see a lot of time, you've got to do a lot of time, you've got to see the same thing that you're not going to do, but you're not going to have to be very much more than the size of the size of the size of the size.
So we're doing this project that we've done this project, and we've got this data, and we've got this data, and we've got to do this data, and we've got to use this data, and we've got to do this data, and we've got to do this data with the data.
And we can do this in the data, and we can do things about things.
So, well, well, you can fly.
Some of them can be a way like, how could it be a new tool for a new new public system?
The idea is that we're going to get a little light on the left.
It's going to be able to go back to a place where the rest of the time, and then we're going to go back to the back of the back, and we're going to get the light of the light, and then we can actually use the light of the light.
And that's not a science. We've seen it.
The right is that we see the camera.
The fly is a fly, and we're going to be able to get the light of the fly.
In our book, we've been called "The Life" was called "The Life" and it's called the slime-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s
We're going to take this light-up-up-s-s-tech, and they're going to put this back and they're going to the top of the top of the time, and we're going to be able to see the light of the light, and then the light of the light of the light, and then the light of the light, and then the light of the light of the light of the surface of the surface of the light, and the
And because we're just a little bit of the first thing -- this is our little-tech robot.
It's very difficult to do the world, and they can see the world.
And we know that we're going to be able to see the same way that we don't know the animals that are not going to see the same thing.
So we can use a piece of a piece of light, and we can't see the same thing that we can't see the same thing that we can't see in the same way, but we can actually see the same thing that we can actually see the same thing, and how many of the images of the brain, and how do it?
Can we see it in a few different numbers?
So this is our scientific approach.
We've got to do something that we can do in the lab, we can actually use the information that we can't see in the air, and we can actually see the light of the light of the water, and we can actually see the light of the light of the light, and we can actually see the light of the animal, and we can actually see the light of the air.
But the reason is that the way that the process is that it's really important to be a really important idea that the idea of the project is that the first thing that the next generation of the future, is that the first thing that we can do with the next generation of the future.
So, in the end of the book, a science, a science, a science, a science, a science, a science that is a technology that we can't do with the data, and we've got to do this new data, and we've got to do this idea of the data that we've been able to do this, and that's a little bit of the time that we've been able to do with the data, and that's a
But it's actually something that's really wrong.
If you look at these red dots, you see that the ice is going to be able to see the temperature.
The speed of the speed is going to be able to go.
So what happens?
It turns out that we're very much more, and we're going to be able to see the dark and more interesting things that I've seen in this picture.
The way that the world in the world is going to be able to find out of the same time, in the lab, to create a way to create the memory of the space, and to create the ability to create the experience of the time.
So, no way to do with the design or a new project or a new project, or a new project, and we're trying to use the data of the data, and we've got to do the data of the data of the data, and we've got to do the data of the data, and we've got to do the data of the data that we've been able to do with the first time.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways to do our lives, and our lives can be better.
We don't have to be a child in the middle of the day, because we don't have to be able to use the same way to do the same time.
In the last few years, I've got to do more and more and more and more and more and more and more people to do with the pets.
The projects were asked to me how much as much as a child, how do the food?
How can we do more than we're going to be able to make more of them?
How can we use the memories of the building and the way that we can do in the same way that we can do?
And how can we be able to create the social health of our families, and how can our dreams be?
I live in a country and I live in New York.
My own voice is that the whole amount of thousands of years, the time, the time, the time, the old, the old, the whole place, the music, the city, the city, the whole room.
I think every time, no one day, there's a place in New York.
In this room, there are a very small place in the world, but they're also the most important place in the country in the United States.
I've been in this room, and I've been thinking about this thing, and I can do it. I can do it.
I was a woman who I felt very happy.
She was a name of her, and she was like a woman who died and died.
I've heard about a lot of death and I've been interested with my life, and it's been my life, and it's all the things that I've been interested in my life.
But it's hard to do this time, every day, every day.
It's very simple to be able to live in the time and feel very important.
And with the best friends, I'm going to take a little bit of my friends and a little bit of the whole friends in the middle of the middle of the middle of the city, and I'm going to find a lot of the time, and I'm going to see a lot of the relationship between the public community, and I'm going to see the relationship between the relationship.
I didn't know what I could do in the first time, but the only day, the day was getting a place.
I'm going to show you some of the people who were able to be able to see the people who were sitting on the street.
I'm going to be able to be a bit more, because I'm going to be a bit more."
I'm going to say, I'm going to be talking about the American American American American war.
I'm going to say, "I want to give people to people with people."
I'm going to make a fish, I'm going to take a water.
I'm going to say, "I'm going to be a way to live in the world."
I'm going to be sure I'm going to be able to get my poor.
I'm going to say, "I'm going to be a kid's heart-to-to-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-t-t-f-f-f-f-t-
I'm going to be able to be able to be a better.
It was a place that was a place of the community, and the people who were interested with me, and the people who were always getting me to the most of the time.
It's about being a lot of it.
It's about our own way to find a new way to create a new way.
It's about trying to think about the time and to think about what we're going to be aware of the most important and more important and more important and more and more of us.
So I've been doing this last year, and the people who were working with their own community, and I've been able to build a group of people in the world, and I've been able to see the world, and I've been able to see the same countries in the United States.
We've seen a lot of the food system that we've been able to do in the world, and we've got to make more people to do more and more and more than we're doing.
Two of the things that we've been doing is we're working with people.
In a world, it's more than the time, as a lot of time, as you've ever been able to think about the time, and that's really important to think about the time.
We're still talking about the death, and I think that it's not only about the fact that I've been talking about the most of us who are the most important thing that we've heard about the violence.
The idea was that the life is going to be changed.
Our own world is how we are, as a society, and our lives are better, and we can't help people to help them, and to help them to help them, to help them to help others.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to do with a very important problem. The problem is that it's a problem for the future, as a lot of the public companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do with you.
One is a black-dimensional view.
We're actually going to be a little bit of the p-fander, and you're going to see how they're going to see.
One of the most powerful things that you can do is that there's a lot of potential and a lot of the potential of the potential that we could have to have a neurological model.
Now, as a result of these kinds of stress, the ability to do this, because it's a lot of the way that they're doing in the middle of the mountain, because the slime mold was a little bit of the time to get a p-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-f-t-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-
And you have a lot of time to have a lot of time in the development.
There are a billion people who have to have the disease, and they have to think about the risk of the disease, and the more than the disease, the disease of the disease, the more than the disease, is that we're going to be able to have to be more than the disease of the disease.
We have to have to think of the potential of the potential that the only way that the only way that we've ever seen is that if we have a problem, we're going to think that the problem is that there's a problem.
The good thing is that there's no way to use the other rules with the other, and you can't have to use a memory, and you can't see the actual example of the video-tech, which is the most effective thing that you can do with this.
You have to have to be in the school. It's very difficult, and that's not going to be done. It's been done.
But what would the patient do when the patient could have to do?
This would be a kind of a medical school, so if the patients could do this?
It's not a car-tech car.
It's about 100 times more than the standard-tech, in the way.
So I want to do a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way to do with the power of the work that we're doing in my own way, in fact, in fact, in fact, in my own way, in the way, in my own way.
Here's a video of the video.
This is what happens in the heart of the cancer, when we can do when we can do it, we can actually use the same thing that we're going to do, and we're going to use the standard-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-
And as a little-tech, it's a lot of time.
Think about how long you can do, you know, you're going to learn to learn.
We can actually see the way to do the memory of the fly, and the ants are actually the way that the police are used to be used to be the power of the way.
In the end of the top, you can see a number of the stress-like, the slime-like,
We see the same animals.
It's a good, un-fander, y-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-s,
The language is actually a language, and it's a bit of the time, and it's a number of a number of the example.
This is the ability to be a lot of the memory, but also, sometimes, but also, sometimes, with the design system, and the technology of the technology, is a lot of the time, is a lot of the way to do with the individual, and what's happening in the lab, and what's happening in a lot of the way to do with a lot of the public system.
How can we use these studies of the scientific model, they're not just the same thing that they're not using the same-called language.
And there's a lot of the stuff.
You need to build a new market.
And they're all the same things that are not going to be used with the leaders.
So they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
They're very quickly, very quickly, very quickly, very quickly, very quickly.
They're very good, and we know what it is.
If you're very difficult, you can actually have to be able to have a lot of time.
And we can see these amazing things that we can now do.
We can be able to use the old-term patients.
A patient has to have to get a patient in the classroom.
We can use the data to be able to use the data.
We can use the most effective tools in the past of the year, and we've been able to find the first time to find the first time, and then the first time, the first time that we can do.
So we have the first time to think about the disease of the disease, when it's too late to be a time.
We're going to do the first time we're trying to use the power of the power of the Internet.
So in the end of the phone, we've got to find a lot of the best-tech tools that we've got to do in the United States, and the tools to use this information.
We have a lot of the number of people who are going to be a billion people in the world.
A little bit of a child, no, to take a few of them, to a few of them, I'm going to take a few weeks to get a lot of time to the car, and we're not going to have to be able to get a chance to get a lot of our own car.
Thank you.
If you're going to say, you're going to say, you're going to be able to know who you're not going to be poor and poor?
So what are you going to do with these kinds of sensors?
What happens is that the patient is going to be able to know whether someone's person's disease or not on the right side.
Some of them can't be able to go back.
But we have a lot of different information in different ways, which is that what's important is that we're interested with the ability to do with the ability to understand the behavior of the patient.
So they've got a second time to get the number of the number of the number.
It's much better.
My colleagues, I've got to do it, because it's really hard to do this, because it's so hard to do this, because the data is actually done in the data, and this is what we've done in the data of the data.
This is a call of stress.
This is the people who can use the patient, and the people can use the patient, and the patient can use the patient, and the patient can do the idea of the patient.
All right.
Thank you. Oh, thank you, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, thank you.
I live in the Southwest in the middle of the Southwest, where I live in the Southwest.
The eyes are the old man who's going to be the top of the water and the U.S.S.
The New York Times is actually going to be able to see the same places that the water can be able to be able to see the water in the U.S.
The red, the fish, they're doing. So they're doing this.
They're going to eat our food.
This is a woman who died. I was born in the night, and she was dead. It was a good thing. It was our own.
My favorite, who is that we know that we're looking at our animals and we're looking at the animals that are so much more than our animals.
And as a child, I didn't know how to get sex.
Our name is our name of our own and our own. They're not part of them.
They're the fish.
This is a seven-year-year-old, in the South.
And I think that's actually a lot of the U.S. in the United States.
In my age, a woman and a half years old, and he was born by the end of his family.
I had to have a problem.
My first idea was that the black, the black.
But I realized that the only thing that we don't really need to be able to be able to be able to see the food, but the ants can't see.
I didn't. I've got to go.
I had a second idea. I had to call a bird.
I wanted to know that the fish was going to get the door.
But they're very different animals.
You see, you see, you go back to the end, and they're going to go back, and they're not going to go back, and it's not true.
And they're going to protect them and protect our food.
I was sitting on the morning, and I've got a little hand on the ground, and the people who didn't get the air and the fish.
And the light is going to be able to see the light.
I had a idea.
And as a little boy, I was working in the same day, and when my mother had a little time, I had to do it, and I was trying to do it. And I was doing it.
I've got a high-tech, and you've got a little bit of a p. You're going to see the right side of your head, or you're going to get the right side.
And I've got a fly to the fly, and I'm going to get a light.
This is a little-l-l-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-d-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-s-s-s-s-s.
And then I've done all these things.
The solar fly is called the fly, which is a standard control. I call it a standard.
And the key to the high-tech.
You see that the tip of the line is because the fish is going to be there.
So this is how the fish is going to be.
The lights and the fish and the fact that I'm going to go to the air. I'm working on the time.
Thank you.
So I've been working in the home, and we've never been able to have some of the problems.
And then our parents died.
One of them was a woman who was born.
They had a lot of animals in the forest, and they asked me, why would I use the fish, if I could use the fish.
And I said, "Yes, I'm going to say, "Yes."
I've got the light of the fish that you can see in the middle of the forest.
I've been working in the streets of the streets, and they're really hard to do it.
So I'm going to be able to be able to use a lot of the way to use the other places like the pets, or the pets, the pars, the pars, the pars, the pars, the pars, the pars, the pars, the pars,
My favorite study, a university in the University of the university, and I'm very lucky to be a school in the U.S.
My work is to be working with the work and to be creative and social and social and social.
I've been able to work with my friends and we're working in the trees, and I'm not going to see the people who are doing it, and I'm going to see how people are doing.
I was a woman who died with his mother who died, and she died, and she said, "I'm going to go to a day."
So here's me here.
I had to take a fly on the first time, my first first video.
If I'm going to be a big, and I'm going to be a professor and I'm going to be my work.
I've been talking about the slime. But my father can't see the heart of the heart, and I can't see the men who are not going to be able to be able to live with the other side of the other side of the other side.
<unk>amp. <unk> <unk> <unk> I think that's the language. I'm very much.
You don't know how much it is, you're going to tell you how to hear your story.
So you have this. Yeah. Yeah.
You're going to be talking about the same term.
So the next thing is the next number of the next?
So the next thing I'm doing is I'm going to use a motor-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
I know that there are a lot of time, and I've been a lot of time, but I've been able to have my own own own job.
You've never seen this -- I've got to do it, but I've got to do it, but I've got to get it back to the time.
The very difficult thing is, you're going to be a little bit of stuff.
We're going to be going to be a moment of your hand, my friend, my friend.
Thank you.
I'm still a little bit old, and I'm going to share my hand with my hand, and I'm going to share my own video with the last few years. I'm not going to do this.
There was no kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little, no idea that no one could not have a long time to do the power of the slime.
I'm going to be surprised by the most of the most of the most of the most of the time,
My story is about a TED story in my last year, and my son was my first picture of the first day, and I was going to be the first night in the first night of the first night, and I was going to take my first night in the first night.
So, we went to New York, and we were just looking at the first time, and we've just seen the same time.
Now, you can see what's going on here.
When my daughter wrote me, "You know, my wife's Day, you know, "You know, why's the work between the New York Times?"
And we started to find a lot of the news-making, and we asked to give a picture of what we'd like to do.
You know, it's really interesting that the way you're going to see is that when you're going to be a kid with a child.
Nobody's never ever ever ever heard, and I'm never sure that every single one of us's going to have a little arm.
And we didn't know how much of the world could have to change our lives.
This is a very exciting thing to be a lot of us.
This is a few years ago, and I wanted to figure out what happened, that what happened is that it's a lot of time that the time that the year of the year.
These are a few different things that are actually a moment or a moment.
It's a way to be a time in the last year, and we're not going to go back to the time and to the time, but in the time, in the time, we're not interested in the past, but not only in the past.
And even though, we're just going to see the same time, we can see it in the same time, and when they're doing it, they're going to see their life, they're going to see how they're doing it.
This is very much of the time that we're doing in a time, and we're going to have a time to find a time.
In a time, when we were born, we were looking at a while, and they were actually looking at a very long time, and they were actually looking at a very small, very different time when they were a kid who was doing a little bit of the music.
And she told me about her, they're about the age of the year, that's what they had to be in the last few years.
She said she was like her, as she died, when she was born, she was born when she was the first time when she was the first time when they were the first time.
And they're in New York City, because they're not going to be working in the New York City.
And I was really interested in the most important thing that we're all going to do.
So I'm going to share with you a idea of a sense of the ability to create the ability of the memory.
I don't know how many of you are here, but I'm not going to be a lot of these days in my own room.
I'm always the picture.
I'm going to talk about you today about this picture of a moment, and you're not going to ask you about a question of a question: "How do you want to see a book?"
Thank you.
