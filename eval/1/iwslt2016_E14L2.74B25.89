When I was 11 years old, I was in the morning of a cheeks of the sounds of the vag.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show from the BBC.
He was very happy at what was rather unusual at the time, because he was most depressed by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban were taking the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned girls to go to school.
So for five years, I was humiliated as a boy, and I was left by my older sister who was not allowed to be on their own, to a secret school.
It was the only way we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so that no one could guess where we were going.
We put our books in shopping bags so it looks like we were going to buy.
We've been in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of a hilar, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
After all, the class of class suddenly had to drop out for a week because the Taliban had swallowed a breath.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
They demand us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued and growing daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
One out of the prison districts from an unorigarian, and he insisted that his daughter -- my mother -- to get to school and was violated by his father.
My mother got a teacher.
Here it is.
Two years ago, she went to retirement just to transform our house to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my dad -- to see here -- was the first one in his family who ever got an education school.
For him, it was always obvious that his kids were going to get an education, even though his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of sending his kids to school.
I remember that I was sometimes so frustrated in the Taliban of our lives, of the constant fear and perspectiveless.
I thought I was good, I had to give up, but my dad said, "Ton-daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing you're going to always remain, is that what's in here. And even if we're going to pay your blood to your lunch fees, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women of my age have higher degree than the Sekocary degree, and if my family hadn't been using so much for my education, I would be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudly Palestinian of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he missed his daughters to go to school, one of the first people that congratulated me.
He doesn't just pay attention to my graduate degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the guy driving him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even more dreams for me.
That's why I am the global ambassador of 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start the idea of creating SOLA, the first Internet service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school girls are still risky.
It's a wonderful thing to see how the students in my school want to see the great ambition of all of them to be aware of their potential.
And seeing their parents and fathers stand for them, and as my parents were at the time, despite all odds, my parents, despite all odds.
As Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and she's about to escape the death of a bomb on the side of the road for just a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang, and a voice threatened to call him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
And he said, "Well, if you want me, I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your old-eyed, forgetting and pre-lilling imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that's often prevented in the West: behind most of us who have success, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realizes that their success is also successing.
That's not to say that our mothers are not necessarily doing important roles in our success.
They're often the ones who are highly illuminating and convincingly admitting for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
The Taliban just went to school a few hundred-and-a-half girls, because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls hold the school bank.
Afghanistan appears, from America, so different.
Americans see how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the lengths and the decline of the U.S. troops changes everything.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me, and the unlimited possibility, and that reminds me of the girls every day, the SOLA.
It's the same way that I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as a profession, my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as young man.
1971 to 1977 -- I look very young, but I'm not -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to projects with technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and I failed every single project we put on the legs.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years, we're a brilliant young person in Italy, and we've made good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we used to be testing.
Our first project, which was inspired by the Tamles at the Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias how to grow food.
We got to the Peruze Islands in the Southeast, in this silly valley, which brings to the Sambesi River, and we trained the local community to grow the Italian tomato and Zocini and ...
Of course, the local people didn't really care about it, so we paid them to do the work, and sometimes they came to work.
And we were surprised that there was no such a fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God you we're here!"
"Mugger's time to save people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these magnificent tomato tomatoes. In Italy they became so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, just like agriculture."
When the tomato bubble was red, over night, about 200 pats of fish came out of the river and they were laughing.
We said to the Sambins, "Oh God, the nunkers!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were an Italian buffeter in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the English world did, and I saw what they did, and after I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We at least fed the cottest.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've not given to the existing African people.
They should read "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a group of traditional economists.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given a 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years of Africa.
I'm not going to tell you what that money has done.
Just read your book.
Think of a African woman what we've done.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, and we pat them, we hypweet them, we are patriarchal.
Both words come from the Latin root, the cater, which means "fater."
They have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture than if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm treating every other culture than they're my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bwana, head.
I got a wakeup when I read the book "Salls Beautiful" of a singing book, and he said, especially in the business economy, if people don't want help, they leave you alone.
That should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
This conference, this morning, opened up, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolroxata?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just respond to people and invent a system called business promotion, where never is initiating something, never being motivated, but you become the local talent provider of the local, the servant of the local, the servant of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you sit down with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet ourselves in kubipens.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to close up with a friend's friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like what you're doing?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own life is the most important thing in humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why not to get into a community and tell people what to do, why don't we listen to them? Not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Never have entrepreneurs, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what they see for choice.
Let's build this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working on one to do this, we need to make social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the hospital hospital hospital, the hospital of the business room with you in the house, sitting in your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the means to find your passion, in a way, to transform your life.
I tried this in Esperverance, West Australia.
I trained at the time, and I tried to escape the disbelief where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking only in the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, my first clients, and I helped him. He was a guy in a garage, he was Maori, and I helped him to sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came, and they said, "You've helped the maor. Can you help?"
I helped these five fishers work together and sell them this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents of K<unk>Kilo, but to Japan for 15 dollars of sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them. Can you help us?"
In one year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold my mouth and I listen to them."
So the government says, "Look, let's try again."
We've done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've been helping about 40,000 companies in founding.
There's a new generation of companies who go on loneliness.
And Peter's printer, one of the best CEO of history, died at 96 years ago.
So Peter's Professor, who was a philosophy professor before he was working on companies. Peter put a printer saying, programming is really unconcompted with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So programming is the death of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, not knowing what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get you to one.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to be clustered up.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most applaudable talk you have in the morning?
"Sear, passionate people. You applaud this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- non-spanable fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn machine is not sustainable.
The free-style of the state is unsustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, to channel, and to share them with them.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Are universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it already now.
I read a wonderful story in a futurist magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to talk about the future of New York City in 18600.
In 1860 they came together and they were speculated, which would happen in the city of New York, and the conclusion was a historical: The city of New York would not exist 100 years ago.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows at the rate, they needed six million horses to get people to get the people out, and it's not possible to get the dung from six million horses.
Because they went under the crap already.
1860 they see the dirty technology that sucks the life of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automobile companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little little factories in the backlands.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing you have to do is to be a copated.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
and then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of them have to be able to do three things: to sell the product, it has to be grand, it has to be great, it has to be great, it has to be a financial system.
You guess what?
We never met a single person who at the same time will produce something, sell and save money.
This is not something that's happening.
This person never was born.
We've done research and we've looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been so popular, one thing that is, one is that no one was founded only by one person.
Now, we teach 16 year-old students in Northland entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them the first two pages of Richard Bransian Autography, and the task of the 16-year-old, is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransonsith Autographiographers, often how he uses the word "write" and often the word "we."
No longer 'ich<unk> and 32 times we eat.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator has a small developer background, sit in cafeteria and Bars. They're dedicated to their job buddy who's going to do what someone in this gentleman has done about this e-shaist who's going to tell you, and someone will say, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you believe I find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate collectors in helping them find the means of the tools and people, and we've found that the wonders of the intelligence of the local population, that the culture of the community can change, and the economy of that community, only by the ability to capture the passion, the energy and the imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be Alice in the miracleland.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to try to connect programs in communication.
I was scared.
Real fear. Fear before these students with their big brains and their large books and their large ones, I don't trust myself.
But when the conversation evolved, it ran me like Alice, when she was pumping down to the eye for the pig, and a door on a new world was a new world.
I also felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed by the idea that they had, and I wanted to see that other magic country was discovered.
I think that we need to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that address our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go on. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-scientist, to be looking for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles country.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please, please, please, please.
So I want to show you a couple of ways that you can do this, that we can see that the science and the technology you're doing with you is busy, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, okay?
Let's tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
It's not just telling us that their chests are being studied, it's telling us that their chids, their sunky structure in our bones, are examining them because it's important to understand ooposis and treat them.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to be exaggerated by the subject.
Sciences are a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use your "fossing" and time-to-time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
To make your mind understand is not the same as to distract your level.
As Einstein said earlier, "Take things just as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without having to compromise in any way.
So a few things are indicating: examples, stories and analogies. So this is how you can take us into your closet.
And if you present your work, let's throw the hits away.
Have you ever wondered why it's called "the point?"
What happens when someone points? Another one is once more than that, and with those dots, the first thing you have to do is to take your audience.
So, a slide like this isn't just boring, it's also too boring to the comments of our brain, and that's how we're being challenged quickly.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the feather is so stable that it was even the inspiration of the original design of the Eiffviem.
The trick here is to use a single, easy sentence to use the audience when it loses the thread, or use images and graphs that even gives our other senses a deeper understanding of what it is.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up these towers and see the wonderland, the science and the engineering of technology.
And because the engineers I've taught, I've taught, I've been teaching to make a tight contact in the <unk>Nat in me, I'd like to sum it all together with an equation.
Look at your science numbers and your writing words, they divide through the popular, so the audience says what's important, and multiply the whole thing you have with your passion that you have for your incredible work, and that gives you a very unimaginable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm very sure.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can actually film a crime in Syria with a cell phone.
You can tweet a phone, launch a message and launch a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a song with a cell phone, upload it up on the sound cloud and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 living in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city at that time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went down to the street and show them what's happening.
We are in the fall of 1989, imagining that all these people who were getting through and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on it?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phone up, hold it up!
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Pale data.
And why are these information?
Because in the summer of 2006, E.U.R. embassy has set up a policy line.
This is a policy line called the Department of Security Protection.
This is a policy that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service service service company in Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who gets to send an email?
Who gets to send a text?
And when you use a cell phone, you use where you're.
All of this information is stored at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And everywhere in Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to use this protection supply.
We want to self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, and they all said, "We don't want to do that."
And here you can see that tens of thousands of people were flowing down on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Funity instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be at the Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the headscimp police in Eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering, is this really going to work?
Can you really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone, I use it?
So I asked my phone company, the Deutsche Committet, who was the largest telephone company in Germany at the time, and I asked her, please, send me all the information you've stored on me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. Just pure Bla Bla.
And then I told myself, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's tracking it.
So I decided to put a court trial against them, because I wanted to have this information.
but the German telegraph said, no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And it ended up being compared to them.
I'm going to pull back the counterage for which they were asking me all to send information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court court court decided that the introduction of the E.U. line was a law enforcement response to the German law.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD, this is what it was.
35.30 lines of information.
At first I saw it, and I said, well, good, it's a giant file. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm asleep at night, I'm sleeping,
And then I told myself, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what the U.S. Security Council means.
So with time and open data town, I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, and you can go ahead and down and down.
You can take every step I do, track it.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt to the train to C<unk>nn, and how many calls I walk along.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes you a little bit scared.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I call my wife up, and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then some friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you up, and you call you, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leader of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction map for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how you can monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who's talking to who's sending an email, all of that is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we've been imagining that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their bag.
And the Stasi had heard who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leader had been, that would probably not have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And even after that, the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, the state agency and companies want to store so many information that they can get about us, online and online.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all at a time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
but you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you'll tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, you say your maidence, just because companies and government states have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company after the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral shops, rapid restaurants, Brakill palms.
So the city planners come in and they thought to change the name of South Central Africa, so that it was somewhere else, it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes something that's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Newfinance stores, rapid restaurants, Braille palms.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivetbbys, and the Drivebys.
The comal is that the Drivethrus kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles from curable diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't really see that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, every time you go out of the house, you see the negative effects that the existing food system on your neighborhood has on your neighborhood.
I've been able to buy the rollmill and sell it as a utility truck.
I see dialogy centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I was at about 45 minutes of a year-old, getting an apple that's not pre-connected with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat from my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the parking lot.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I got to the L.A. Green Grasses, together, and we started planting my food park and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're kind of a pre-med group, put together by all the social layers and from all over the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do, free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically gave me a control station, and he said that I needed to remove my lawn, the front row was a connotable configuration.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A set of reports for growing food on a piece of land that doesn't care about you?
And I thought, "Cool. She's doing it."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city station, and I had a member of Green Ground, and I got a petition on Change.org, and we succeeded with 900 signatures.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My town even called it, and said they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why don't they do that?
L.A. has the largest hardware store in the United States in the country in the country.
They have 4,200 kilometers of hardware store.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell shouldn't you find that?
You get 1,000 seeds from the plant, 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my niece. I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To grow its own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more ashamed to be part of this preconventable reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
So, the gardenwork is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's punching the walls, I'm eating lawns and air plants.
I use the garden, the earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my actions for this stuff.
You'd be surprised to see what the ground is all that can be done if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
You'd be wondering how kids are affected by this.
Such as gardening is the most therapeutic and the most audacious act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can get strawberries.
I remember this time when this mother came and her daughter, it was about 10:3 p.m. at night. They were in my backyard, and I got out and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that made me feel just more powerful to do that. People told me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum devil, no, no, I'm not afraid that they're clinging.
It's on the street.
So that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time I want you to take care of their health."
Another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to access the truck to the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted their mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, and maybe only for a moment.
Green Grasses have already planted about 20 gardens.
We got 50 people and we did it, and they're all volunteers.
When you grow carbon, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
If they don't get any of them, if they're not shown, how food and body affects them, they eat blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids who are just on the path that's thought they're looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
The gardening, I see as an opportunity to train these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make George Washington Carver the next place.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole residential block in gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscontard and turn it into a healthy cafes.
So, you don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free shit, because free is not sustainable.
The comet of sustainability is you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy of the pride and the honor of getting them to the food, if you build your own food, and when you open farmers.
So, what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to be all ecological rebels, gang, gangmen, gang gardeners.
We need to turn the image of the hallway.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang catch.
You're going to have to get a shower, you know?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up if you want to sit in a game room and get a meeting where you're talking about doing some of the chairs.
If you want to meet me, you come to your kitchen, in my backyard, so we can plant some tush.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "nnnollygaster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nollygoster" means "a-free politician."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper host held a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who plays a workshop regardless of the party, or program or its success, through the pure power of the monumental hypothetical bias."
I have no idea what a paper is.
I think something about it.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers were not the exact same word of debutting the debut.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who had moved to parliament with the women.
She threw him down to the Tower of London, and he fumbling him, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to win, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so believe in Brassif."
Brassks are all about the English word for a tin.
But that's not true. It's going back to a secret agent of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States, at the time when it's just their independence.
You're looking at the question of what you should call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
What's the leader of a national nation like?
and it was documented in Congress for an infinite amount of time.
And there were all kinds of possible suggestions to this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Governor Washington, and others, the high-rurity George Washington, and again, the defenses of the people of the United States of America, the United States of Washington.
Not so sure.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it's safe.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored in a little bit, because this debate had three weeks.
I read the journal book of a Senate that's always written: "Take the same topic."
The reason for the delay and the boredom was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The Kansas House didn't want Washington to be a kitchy. They didn't want to.
The king would call it, and it might even be on ideas for its success.
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most vulnerable, the most destest title they could think of.
This was a cover that was called "Pisord."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he just meant that someone was pre-felled to be a meeting.
It's something like the pre-first stop.
He had no longer the size of the record "Deargle" or "Dearch."
Sometimes there were little colonial people and government groups, but it was really unmanned title.
So the Senate refused to drop it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to sign up the agreement and meet foreign-changer.
Who will take him seriously when he has a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, you've been thinking of using the title "diction" in front of it, but they absolutely understand that they didn't agree in the face of their respectful, respectable, individual, unknown to the nations, whether it's in the United States, where it's the state of the state, it's not necessarily imposed by the singular name of the state of the state -- not necessarily assertants of the people in the United States.
You can learn about three interesting things.
One is -- and I think it's best -- until now I can't find out whether the Senate has ever been formalized by the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just given the title, and he's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
The second thing you can learn is that if a government says that something is temporary -- wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of the United States today sounds so humorous, isn't it?
It's got to do with the more 5,000 nuclear swamps that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drone and all that stuff.
It's not real and story that has given the title of size.
And that's how the Senate ended up.
They've got a respectable title.
The other concerning the Senate, the sounds of self-esteem -- well, it was.
You know how many nations do you have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end of the Senate, the Senate lost the representative house, because nobody feels humbling when you're told you're now the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, words change the reality much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a truck about 50 rebellion to the fight of junalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would sit on my black Connic gloves against a pair of brown leatherymles and fireing a rocket towards the government franchil that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been a big war before that, but besides Pyjama party and football game at Samsen and Reverts with racist South-state groups, and all the overarchious demonstrations that never lived with communism and Afghanistan and Afghanistan and Afghanistan and Viennh, and Conceptions before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I've got to call Afghans, South nations, from God's Gnades. An atheist, and a radically political artist who's been working in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like painting rainbows. I want to make art mixed together, that challenges personality and authority, and it's reflected in the reality, and it's even used a kind of a kind of imaginative citizen curriculum to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- the jihadist against communist communist, like "Pop-Soping" and use abusive religious and political corruption to enrich himself.
And what can jihad-firstnament do, as for the parliament, and to do a choice campaign with the slogan, "Please choose me! I'm jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi who spend on national superheroes.
I want to leave the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rearing," where you're a police officer, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and the car, but instead of taking bribes from them, spend money on the name of Kabul on them, and they're assured by the police in the guerrilla, and they hope that they're going to take us 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become, I believe, the traditional conflict.
The war and the stranger who came to them has created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was creating the deep-doc-for-doc-your-doc-yourself-yourself-yourself-pepper or multiple tile-pethrough a bi-pillo-pillated epic engineering effort.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan of Kabul looks like Kiplingsell from 1899 to create a dialogue about the current development organizations of their origins in the past-dominated rhetoric about the white man's white man to protect the brown man behind themselves and maybe even a little bit of civic.
But for all these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
But I do, because I have to, because the geography of self is self-sitting.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
It's been said 10 years ago.
I feel like I've built a very unconditional tension in the room here, because I don't want to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I've got something to change.
This is the first time someone walks up at the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness to see that.
If there were a couple of women who were really shooking out when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I'm going to read it on Twitter later.
I also recognize that I'm quite privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, what you think of me.
It doesn't have any chance to do that.
These tracks are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because you're all going to wake me off, you're not doing anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also super-ficial.
I've just changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never had a friend in the picture.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I could throw my back oil, and with my hand, he put his hair on this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong ones I've been thinking about for the work two days ago, there's very few ways to change our utterness, and our utterance has, although it's super-span and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Fearless to be, to me, is to be honest.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this an sexy girl.
So I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a reward in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and you might ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, in the way that admiration is programmed to be biologically, but also as big, pine, feminine and bright blue.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's paid to me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point. And maybe some fashionist mail calls, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra Sman. Liu."
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I'm sorry to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has all been counted modules on the run, every single one that's been marged, and that in 677 simules, only 27 or less than four percent of them were not white.
The next question that's always being asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which would be completely misinformation, because you're the first one."
If you say, after this great trade, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "I'm going to call my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head editor of American bird letters or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like you're going to say you're going to win the Jackor in the numero.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career way.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a trained model of knowledge, because different from heart surgeons, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is just there, like a nice radiationer, and the client says, "Cameron, we want to take a picture in the run," now, the leg goes first, long, long, long, long, and this arm goes back to the front, the head is on the left, and you move back to the side of three-quarters, and just just go back and you see it again, you see, your own
It looks something like this.
I hope that it's less strange than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and you've made a life cycle and you've done a few jobs, unfortunately you can't say much more. If you say you want to be president of the United States, but you're going to be looking at "10 years of underwear," you're going to be looking at weird.
The next question that's often being asked to me is, "Who are you going to vaccinate all the photos?"
And yes, so much of the photos are retured, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the very first photograph I did, and that was the very first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time on that period.
I know this is going to be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
This is how I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the launch.
My friend had to come with me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a shooting for French birdry.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're construction, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the pre-propination. They're building this. I'm not.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You're doing things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot-cunk gloves I can never wear, except for the things I get free, things I get in real life that I don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I lost my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I drove with my friend, a terrible driver, and she passed over a red light, and of course we stopped, and it took a call: "Excuse me, Mr. Wagmeister," and we could go on.
I got this free stuff because of my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay for their appearance and not because of their personality, they pay a high price.
I live in New York, and the 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped last year and shot, and there were 85 percent black black and Latino and mostly young men.
There are only 177,000 young black black and Latino-American men who are not asking the question, "Am I going to be rejected?"
It's like, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When I'm going to quit?"
In my research to this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up at 78 percent when they got 17 percent.
The last question I have to ask myself is, "Well, what is it like to be a model?"
And I think they'll expect that answer: "If you're a little bit thinner and darker hair, you'll feel very happy and fab."
And we give backstage a response that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's just half the story, because what we never say before the camera, what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure because every day I have to think about my appearance.
And if you ever ask, "I'm happier if I had thin legs and darker hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most gloomy hair and the most cool flam and they're most vulnerable to their appearance on the planet.
When I prepared this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to move an honest track, because I felt very uncomfortable to put myself up here and say, "I got all the benefits from a stack that was being dragged into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that makes me not always happy."
It was very difficult to use a heritage of oppression and race when I was one of the largest uses of it.
But I'm also lucky, and I'm honored to be here, and I find it great that I've made this up here before 10 or 30 years before my career has gone, because I'm probably not going to tell my first job, or I'd probably not say, I'd have paid to tell you how college has paid, which is so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our strange failures and failures more likely.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who has come to life in exile, "Son, league Gaddafi. Have he.
But never will, like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been almost two years since the Senate has been re-built the monitified revolution, inspired by the waves of mass media in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I connected myself to many other Libyans, within and outside Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and launch a revolution against the tyrannic regime of Gadadis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Young, licensed women and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, held Slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice into the air.
They've demonstrated some examples of courage by putting on the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They've seen a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the far of the West, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 deaths, it made us free ourselves to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a huge hospital, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption, and the foundation of the course of the book.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regime destroyed both infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges I once discovered how many other women re-growing civil society back to the civil society, and we demanded a publicized and un-paced transition to democracy and national acumen.
Near 200 organizations, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis, in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exil, I came back to Lybia, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops to the issues of capacity, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform of women, a movement of women, leaders from various different backgrounds, whose goal is to be in public, public, to the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to make our right right right to vote on democracy and democracy.
In the case of the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and exclusion.
I led an initiative to the peacebuilding platform to get women to a nationalized rule, a law that every citizen, no matter what context, should vote, and to vote, and, above all, to a political parties between men and female candidates on vertical and vertical-level, and to make a constant discountment to make a difference.
and we're at the end of it, and we're actually being replicated and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the national bank worker in the first elections since 52 years.
But long, the euphoria of the elections and the whole revolution, because every day we started to get to new messages about violence.
One morning we entered the news about the killing of ancient mosques and Sufi sons.
In another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
and then another morning, the suicide bombed of the army was signed up.
And indeed, every day under the leadership of the militias and their ongoing events against human trafficking and their misguuriation of laws and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind preservation, polarized, and removed from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice that they had initially.
Intent, rejection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you for the success story of our failed list and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that we, as a nation, have made the false choice and wrong choices.
We've been wrong with our priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the hardest and change between women and male candidates have made peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What's it?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate the political of domination and the banal and the common of men and women?
Perhaps the women who missed the only thing, but the female values of compassion, the Gade, and the accidental.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus when it took the elections, and at the end, it has only strengthen the polarization and seizure.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop acting in the name of the raviation and demanding a day of the revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just claim the results, but also it also promises: the revenge instead of revenge, cooperation instead of compulsing, instead of rejecting a female.
These are the ideals that need a war of rumor to desperately get peace to.
Because peace has an alchemie, and in this alchemie, it's about the cross-mistating of feminine and maskal view.
That's the real punching.
And we need to do that in an existential way before we do sociopolitical.
After an act of "Salam" -- peace is "is the word of the Good God, laminate."
The word "raem" again, which is known in all the latehamian traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "lonophony" -- "in mother, symbolically symbolically, the female of all humanity, the man of the man and the female, the female of all the tribes and all the peoples.
And just like the mother rado, which grows in his embryo, completely surpasses the basic mind of compassion, the whole existence of the existence.
And so we were told, "My Gade Adads are all doing things."
So we were told, "My Gnade has pre-suppled before my fortune."
Anyone who's going to be the waltie that we're going to be getting.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud of that.
In school, we took the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until it was a changeable moment.
At the time of seven, I saw a public refiniation, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer from hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter to my mother, and the sister of a colleague.
And he said, "If you're listening to this, our five family members are not going to be on this planet anymore, because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're all on the ground and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly after that, I went over to the station and saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A squad drowned woman on the ground, and a burned kid in her arm smelled helplessly in his mother's face.
Nobody helped them because they all worked so hard to care for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'9s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end of the day, more than a million North Koreans liked to sacrifice the famine, and many more survived because they ate grass, beetles and tree levels.
Oilcesss are increasingly more and more likely to be worse at night, except for the lights of China on the other side of the boat that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amhront, which is part of the North Korea as a border between China and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vigorously and enabled North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw body bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can tell that I was sent to China during the late years of the devastating famine,
I just thought I was separated by my family for a short time.
I never thought it took to live again in 14 years.
In China, it was very difficult for a young girl to live without family.
I didn't have any idea of what life would be like as a North Korean refugee. But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in an increasingly fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to North Korea in a terrible fate.
One day, my biggest nightmare dream was when I was caught up in the police department and was sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be Northern Korean, so they tested my Chinese names and they asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid of my heart to explode.
So, I could be imprisoned, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions, and I answered the questions.
And after they finished the poll, a official said to the other one: "That was a falcon.
She's not a North Korean."
They let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are testing on foreign messages like Asyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they're caught, they were finally released by tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have that much happiness.
Every year, there are tons of North Koreans in China, and they're already tracking North Korea, where they're tortured, imprisoned or re-animated in public.
Even though I was lucky enough to be able to do so many other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
She's also learning a new language and finding work can be put into her world in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was leaving South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I would have thought.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start my third language.
I also saw the difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of it we've been very diverged by a partial basis, because of 67 years.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstanist?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't fall easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording app at the university.
Just as I became more normal in my new life, I got an alarming phone call.
The North Bronx authorities started taking the money that I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family forced to relay to a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as quickly as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China and made me go to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles across China, and then Southeast Asia.
The bus drive lasted a week, and we got almost several times caught.
Once, when the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the branch of everybody, and he started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I decided I would go up and tell him that she was a child-in-law, and I was her bossy.
He looked at me ruthless, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to get to the Portuguese border, but I had to spend almost all my money trying to bribe the borderline of Laos.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was imprisoned because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and cash money, my family had been released within a month, but soon after my family, my family was re-animated, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the greatest blessings of my life.
I'd done everything to protect my family for freedom, and we were so close, but my family had been arrested, just before the South Korean message.
I went out and I went between the immigrant agency and the police department, trying to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back to the cash or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And the guy asked me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is busy.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I started my situation and I didn't even go to a bank engine, and I paid the money to my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about the whole heart of hearts, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The former stranger, I think, symbolized hope for me, who needed a new hope that the North Koreans need, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I've been united to South Korea, but the freedom of it is only one step.
Most North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they get into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, the English learning, the professional education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family support, and we're sending them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I've been so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I've been hoping for my most sacred North Koreans to succeed with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
He's giving him a little uncomfortable, and he's not going to give them a second.
It's not lousy. He doesn't listen to the color color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and he's just telling you, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from childhood, he tries to words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of a thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It has absolutely unconditional memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate fries, but he remembers the publication of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the very first result of the teoon was to put on my arm on my arm on my arm and grandma birthday.
Don't listen to them?
A lot of people don't vote.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often have been over and wrong.
But what motivated my heart and strengthened my soul was that although that was the case, even though it hadn't been considered a normal, it could only mean that it was extraordinary -- with autism and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compatism," it's a complex psychiatric disorder of the brain that affects social communication, learning and even physical skill.
It's a different feature in every individual, so Remi is so different from Sam.
And the world's been observed every 20 minutes in a new person of autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been through autism, but I can't remember it every day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He was very greeding.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy on the tiniest things, like cars in a row of room, putting the washing machine in and eating everything that was coming under him.
And when he got older, he was different, and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the Freltess and the never-eaning hyperactivity, something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never suffered.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going back to the things they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I'm going to see that these are things I'd rather be trying to trade against normality.
Normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everyone has a gift, and everyone of us, all of us, honesty, is the pursuit of normality, is the ultimate sacrifices of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change dies at the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Ederton has filled us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph on a project that a apple is being harvested and a half a second of a pigry.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and the world doesn't see with a million or a billion frames per second, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create slow-time-speed images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look at the outside of our view of the space, or without any <unk>-ray in our body, and actually question what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it off to a billionth of a second -- these are several parts of Femby's, I make a package of photons that's hardly a thin, and this photons pack, this project, will move at speed of light, and, as I said, a million times a normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photons pack, and you shoot it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's the point of light?
So, this whole event.
So, think about this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanotipip -- so long as long as you go back this route -- but I need to slow this video to 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this, and let me show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon dish, and it starts to move through it, and eventually break through it.
And part of the light comes out onto the table, and you see that spread of waves.
A lot of the photons eventually reach the shock of the bottle and explode into different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in the bottle that's going to be lit around.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table are spread out, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some pictures.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back and take the same route, and then you slow the video back to 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here to see the film?
One day, a week? No. One year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little still-living photography?
You can see again, like the waves of the table, the Tomber and the wall in the back of the screen.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like nature was painting this picture, and every time it's a Femto image, but of course our eye looks a coupled frames.
But if you look at these Toms, you'll see that if the lights over, the lights will be flashing over, it will remain dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomrow is mature, and the light jumps in your building, and it comes back after several billion seconds.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and see if an fruit is a stable, without touching it.
So, how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of prehistoric time, you have very little light, but we're putting together a billion times faster than the shortest radiation time you get, so you're not getting any light at all.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons pack, and we're drawing it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what if it were a new superpower for a future superhero, can see corners?
The idea is that we're going to illuminate some light on the door.
It will be clogged into the room, one part of it will bounce back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use that more quadruly spacing of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
There's a soup hidden behind the wall, and we're going to break the lights off the door.
After our paper was published in the National Communications department, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to chop up the light project, and they're going to pour it back into this wall, and this photons pack will be all in every direction, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup, that will break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light from a broken light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but it's going to be interesting in a moment.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-solving system, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, by the way of getting the door out, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of the distance is.
So by leveraging a laser, we can record a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we record many of these pictures, dozens of these pictures, and we try to analyze the different light walls, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We've got some more work before we can implement this into the lab, we could build cars that avoid collisions and detect what's behind the curve, or we can search in dangerous rates of survivors, by looking at light, by reflected light, or we can build final noads that see deep in the body around Ok, and also see the powder around the box.
But for the blood and tissue, of course, that's very challenging, and that's really a wake-up call for scientists to think about Femto photography, because a new visual procedure could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like a Docockon, even a scientist, a science has become a art, a art of the ultra-fight photography, and I realized that all this gigabytes of data we collect every single time, not just a scientific image, but we can also create a new form of computer photography, with paint and color, and with a timbrevon, and we can just look at all of those waves, and we can't even see each of those times the
But it's also something that happens here.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost recording at the speed of light, we've had strange effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly incredible.
The sequence of what's going on in the world is going to appear in the camera in reverse order, in the process of using the specific relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So, whether it's photography around the edges, or building a new imaging tool for medicine or new design forms, since we've been able to open up all the data on our site and hope that the "momen" will be the creative and the research community that we're trying to stop ourselves from the megapotometer to the next-to-to-one-one-to-one-one-one-to-one-step-to-face.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many teachers can't be passed, but we use the same public space.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like a sticker, a scoop, aphon, and a circle.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent is it that they pay to my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the home-to-loid houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is reassured by the giant euths that had been giving up to hundreds of years of loved loved ones, drunk, drunk, and evener shade, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never sees, in New Orleans there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most abandoned parts in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how I could get it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me, and suddenly her death came out and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I've been able to feel a great gratitude for my life, and it's given me clarity of the things that I've been interested in in in in in life now.
But I'm very hard to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and forget about what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard and I wrote with a bridge in the gaps: "Have I die, I want to die." Everyone who can come, take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it grew and grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I'd die." I'd like to be sued for piracy."
"I'd like to die before I'd like to be a broad-lived over the International Crisis line."
"I'd die." I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'd die." I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die before I live."
"I'd like to die, I'd like to keep them in my arms once."
"I'd die." I'd like to be a chapcavic."
"I want to die." I want to be myself."
It was neglected to a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of the people brought me to the laugh, to the wine, and to the tears, and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and more imaginative way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and remembering and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I've given hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a construction kit, and now we've been building a local box in countries like Kasakan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right view, thinking about it, that life is short and sensitive.
We're often held by talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that makes us most powerful.
The idea of death makes us feel.
Our common places are the best important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people can't just help us to create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in effective mathematics. It's a very special problem for anyone who's busy in disgusting mathematics is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to explain what I do.
And dancing is one of the most human activities.
We're excited about the fact that we're going to be able to see the uterder ball and teets that you're going to see in the same way.
There's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and potentially a fundamental signal that a genetic component might have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability, and that's what it does for me to know about the people who met Schbes Abpling, who was a ballet injury at the time.
Over the years, we've been making a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet, in the world, there are 6.3 million people suffering from this disease, and they need to live with the most unhealthy symptom of the sword, the tremor, the cisidity, the more that cause that disease, and that's why we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know is, is there a cure if we have a objective measure that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there's no cognitive stress that we have Parkinson's disease, and other movements of movements, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's in this 20-minute test is in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies that never is done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would make a trained tour to the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't take a teensant hospital.
It costs 300 percent to be studied in the neurologic unit, by the way.
So I want to suggest to you that there's an unconventional way that we're trying to achieve this, because we're all, in some sense, virtual, virtual nuos like my name Jan Abval.
So here's a video of the vibrating vocal flams.
This is what happens in the normal state, when someone creates speech sounds, we can look at the coherent ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all of these vocal organs, if we can make records, and we all have the genes for FoxP2, for example.
And it takes a lot of practice, like ballet.
Think about how long a kid it takes to learn to speak.
So by the way we can use the input of the vibrating vocal tone, and the way the limbs are also affected by the mood of Parkinson's disease.
In the lower record, you can see an example of the irregular vocal evidence of evidence.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Bad, weakness, jeality.
Language will even be used to be more and more gentle and more comfortable, and that's an example of the number of symbols.
And this effects of the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and symptoms of evidence analysis, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now see where someone's in a spon of disease and health, just because of the sounds of the vocal.
So how can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test is in neurologists.
It's not that small. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both are accurate. They're not done for the right test or the experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very quick, very high, very high-powerful, 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're extremely cheap, you can use it in a very high amount.
So this is a staggering goals that we can do now.
We can reduce logistics difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine interfaces in the hospital.
We can get objective data from a broad historical observation.
We can do low-cost breeding for clinical trials for clinical trials, and we're going to be able to do it for the first time in the whole population.
We now have the ability to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step in this direction, we're going to start Parkinson's room.
With Aculab and patient bike, we want to take a very high number of voices worldwide to have enough initial data to provide the potential of these goals.
We have a call-bars that are three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who's using no Parkinson's disease can call cheaply to leave a few-second photos for a few cents. I'll say that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of, say, do you take 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happening is that the patient has to tell you that the patient has to do with the caller, whether this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them won't get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in many different circumstances, which is interesting. Those conditions are important, because we're wired to this, to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is their ability?
It's much better.
My students, Thanasis -- I have to blame him because he's done such amazing work -- has shown that it's working on the cellular network, which is what's enabled this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call that improvement.
That means that people can call the phone phone, and people can call the test, and they could call people with Parkinson's disease, they can take their voice, so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see my father's cows in the back, and behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just wrapped in the South, and that means that wildlife can fly the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buock.
My tribe, the Native Americans, believes that we came together with our animals and the heavens's orbit, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I've only been learning lions as a kid.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our ancestors. They're also on this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
My family is a boy who is between six and nine yearsly responsible for his father's cows. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but it's helping the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't stand up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I'd be next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You get to see the bird go back and go back. And the next time, but the next time they come, and they come up and they say, this thing doesn't move, that's still there.
and they take a handle and kill our livestock.
One night, I was listening to the stall. I was walking around with a torch, and this time the lions didn't catch.
And the lions fear light, the light moves.
I had an idea.
As a young boy, I was working in my room all day, and once again, I took the new radio from my mom, and the day it took me almost almost to see me, but I learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a motor service from a motorcycle, and it shows that if you want to turn on the left or the left, it's flashing.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little pearne from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel generates the battery, the battery provides electricity to the server. I call it a transformer.
And the safety of the server is flashing.
You can see that the sins are going to be outside, because of the fact that's where the lions come from.
This is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights flashing and the lions believe I'm walking around the bar, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and since then, we didn't have any problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yeah."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I have seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they work really well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including for other predators like hyenops or leopards, and the lights serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention gave me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been committed to fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights in, and we're going to install the lights where there's no one, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
I was just a boy in the savanna who was eating his father's cows, and I saw planes over me and I said, "Eadorrow, I'm going to sit in one!"
And here I am.
I was allowed to create an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to be singing. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father, and the lions, together, we can live side by the lions, without argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, "I thank you.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you are.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next list?
So, my next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An electroconce fence.
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, right -- yes, I tried it a little bit, but I've been back to the trial because I got a blow.
The first is hard. Richard Turer, you're something special.
We're going to hire you every step of your walk, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
For the last time I've been old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I'd like to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and I've never done one of them.
There was no style, no style, no chance of shooting a picture. Not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random, historical tourists.
My story starts when I was in New York for a talk, and my wife made this picture, where I held my daughter on my first birthday on my arm, and we were at the corner of 57ster and 5th.
And just a year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this is going.
When my daughter's third birthday boy came up, "Hey, why are you going to go to Sabina not to New York and do a father's daughter's daughter's Day to continue the ritual?"
And at the time, we started asking for tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're having a completely alien camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one has ever been blinded to our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just weeks after 9<unk>11 and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a shot moment, or a specific journey.
They're also a possibility for us to take place in October, to keep time and change our time and how we're going to change the year year, not just physically, but in everything.
Although we always make the same picture, our perspective of time is changing as it moves over time, as it's increasing new milestone, I can see life with their eyes, as it does with everything that it sees.
This is a very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value, and every year we expect.
So, in the short run of our trips, we walked for a walk, and suddenly they'd been moving down like this, and it shows a red brand on a dollhouse that they'd learned as a young kid, at the previous age of travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old about this particular place.
She said she remembered her heart of the chest when she first saw the store on the first time nine years ago.
And now she looks at high schools in New York because she's interested in studying in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we're all creating is memories.
And so I want to share the idea of taking an active role in conscious memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm hardly nearly a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage all of you to come up with the image and ask you not to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 25.89, 56.2/33.1/20.9/13.2 (BP=0.969, ration=0.969)
