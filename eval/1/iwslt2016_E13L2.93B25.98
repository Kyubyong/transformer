When I was 11 years old, I was a night of the songs of the sound of the thumb.
My father listened to his little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was rather unusual at the time, because he was most depressed by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but my father obviously did very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban was moving the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
And so I was five years old, and I was with my older sister who had no longer been preparing for himself to be a secret school.
It was the only way we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so that no one could guess where we were going.
We put our books in shopping bag, so it looks like we're just going to buy.
We've been served in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was a hilarious thing, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and she had to go back to class and suddenly, because the Taliban had to rate.
We'd never been sure how much they knew about us.
They demanded us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family where education was important and daughters were valued.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
One of the outsider from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to go to school and was distracted by his father.
But my mother was a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to turn our house into school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- you see here -- was the first person in his family ever received a education.
It was always obvious for his kids to be educated, even his daughters, despite all the guards, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk to send his kids to school.
I remember the fact that I was so frustrated in the Taliban in the years, sometimes I was so frustrated by our lives, of perpetual fear and the perspectiveless.
I was so good to give up, but my father said, "Tin-daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing is always going to stay you: what's in here. And even if we have to pay your blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So, you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have a higher degree than the capitalist degree, and if my family didn't have been used so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I stand here today, as a proud, middle-class college.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was released from his family, because he was willing to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones that congratulations me.
He's not just paying attention to my graduate school, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the guy driving him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I am global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start building SOLA, the first and possibly the only internial for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school school girls are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to feel great ambition for all of them to think about potential opportunities.
And to see their parents and fathers, like they were, including my parents, despite all the time, and against all the opposition.
As Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
and just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and she is out of a bomb on the side of the road for only a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone ranged, and a voice driver would beat him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
And he said, "Look, if you want me now, I'm not going to be going to put the future of my daughter's future because of your old-eyed and over-the-explain imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've discovered something that is often prevented in the West: behind most of us, the success is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realizes that their success is also success.
I don't mean that our mothers are not necessarily playing a role in our success.
They're often the ones that are often more and more powerful and compelling about a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And the Taliban went to school for a few hundred-dozen girls, because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls have a bank bank.
Afghanistan appears to be looking like America, so different.
Americans see how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that change is not the lengths, and it's changing everything in the U.S. troops's population.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, who are encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me, a country of hope and the unconciliation, and it reminds me of the girls who go to the SOLA every day.
Just like me, they have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as a profession, my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
1971 to 1977, I look young, but I'm not -- -- -- -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, projects with the technical collaboration with Africa.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and I failed every single project we put on the legs.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years ago, we were brilliant people, and we were very good jobs in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we used to do.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book, "Ripples at the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias how to grow food.
We came to the local elephant farms in South Africa, in this disruptive valley, which leads to Sambesi River, and we taught the local community to grow the Italian tomato sauce and Tchini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came to work.
And we were surprised to see that there was no such fertile valley agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make it, we just said, "Thank God that we're here!"
"Mave only time to save the people of Sambias before the star starvation."
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had these gorgeous tomatoatoes. In Italy, they became so large, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato bubble was turning red and red, about 200 pats of pine came out of the river and everything.
We said to the Sambins, "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were so great at planting our villages in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what did the French, and after I saw what they were doing, I was proud to be proud of our project in Zambia.
We've been feeding the pine.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've not given to the existing African.
They should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a Cbian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was doing.
You can just read your book.
You read from a African woman what we've done.
We are Western people, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we hypnotize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words come from the Latin root, the cater, which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I'm going to have every other culture as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm going to have every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bwana, boss.
I became gruder when I read the book "Sall Beautiful" of Shum. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, they leave you alone.
This was the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This conference, this morning, opened up, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocololata?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people and invented a system called the company who never is initiated, never gets somebody, but you become the service of local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you sit down with the local community.
We're not working on offices.
We meet ourselves in cafeteria. We meet in kelips.
We have no infrastructure.
We close with friend's friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like this, what do you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in human history.
We're helping them find knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of getting into a community and saying, what are they going to do, why don't we listen to them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
Entrepreneurs never have been part, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Building has a blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working on one to do this, and we have to be building a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new profession has to be created.
This is the home-of-the-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-the-the-school-school-the-school-school-school-school-school-Moulder, where you're helping the resources to find your passion in a way to transform your life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I trained at the time, and I tried to escape the disbelief where we say to others what to do.
And so I walked only through the streets in the first year, and I had my first three days of my first clients. I helped him find fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then they came to the fishermen, and they said, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishermen work together, and they're not selling this amazing tuna into a factory in Albany for 60 cents perKilo, but they're going to be on to Sushi for 15 dollars to sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them do this. Can you help us?"
In a year, I had started to run 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How are you doing this?
How do you make? I said, "I do something very, very hard.
I hold my mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- So the government says, "Look, let's do it again."
We've made it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 60,000 companies in the founding.
There is a new generation of companies who are going to go out of loneliness.
And Peter's printer, one of the best corporate CEOs in history, died by 96 years ago.
And Peter's first graphic professor, before he was working with companies, Peter Peter said, programming is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Building is the death gap of entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchchurch, without knowing what the smartest human Christchurch, and then you want to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get you to one.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come up with a lot of disconnections.
In a community of 10,000 people, we're going to get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are the best applaudy of the presentation you have today?
"Sear, passionate people. You applaud this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-spaning fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are unsustainable.
The burn machine is unsustainable.
The free-style of preservation is unsustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, create and transfer them with them.
The technologies that are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
Governments? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to talk about the future of the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and speculated what would happen in the city of New York 100 years, and the conclusion was, the city of New York would not exist 100 years ago.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grew at the same rate, they needed six million horses to get people to get them, and it's impossible to get the dung from six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
1860 is the dirty technology that's buried in New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology made the race. There were little small factories in the backlands.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing you have to do is to be offered to them some discontion.
Otherwise, they're not coming and talking to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
and then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of them have to be able to do three things: to sell grand, the sales market must be grand, and the financial accounting needs to be huge.
What do you have?
We never met a single person who can make something at the same time, sell and help them take money.
This is not something that exists.
This person was never born.
We've done research and we've looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie Winghouse, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been common, one thing: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach our year-old graduates in North Korea, and we start teaching them to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransian Autographics. The task is 16-year-old, in which the first two sides of Richard Bransons Imscreen, often how he uses the word "us" and "hite" and "we" as often.
Never "I," and 32 times, "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where a community of worker who has a small community of developers sitting in cafeteria and Bars, and their dedicated buddy who will do what someone in this gentleman who speaks about this E.<unk>s speaking to you. Somebody who will say, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting organizations to help them find the resources and people, and we've found that the wonders of the intelligence of the local population, that culture and the economy of the community can be transformed, only by the one that is the passion, energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be Alice in the miracles country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to try to divide engineers in communication.
I was scared.
Real fear. Fear to these students with their large brains and their large books and their large, not familiar words.
But as the conversation evolved, it started to look like Alice, when she was pumping down to the tapestoch and saw a door on a new world.
I also felt that when I was talking to the students, I was amazed at the idea that they had, and I wanted to find that other one of these miraculous land.
I think to open these towers, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, then we don't understand it, and I think it's our responsibility as a non-religious scientist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles country.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, bear with us.
I want to show you some of the ways that you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy doing is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, okay?
Let's tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
It's not just telling us that their chids are studying their feathers, but it also tells us that their chids, the pinnery structure in our bones, are examining in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat ooposis.
And when you describe what you do, then you're not going to have any pronouncies.
Now, the arguments are a obstacle to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use your "go and time-to-time," but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
We're trying to make our thoughts understand, not the same as the same as throwing down your level.
As Einstein said earlier, "Make things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You may have told us something about your scientific area without having to compromise.
So one of the things that we're looking at is examples of stories and examples of analogies. They can take you to your him.
And if you present your work, let's throw away the hits.
Have you ever asked yourselves why it's called "the point point?
What happens when someone stands? Another one is going to be cut, and with these dots, the first one is your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the conversation about the brain, and that's how we're very quickly advancing.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the feather is so robust that it actually was the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffviem Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple, fantasy sentence that the audience can, once it loses the thread, interpret images and graphs that also address our other senses, and create a deeper understanding of what it is that tells you.
These are just a couple of other approaches that help us open these towers and see the wonderland that supports science and technology.
And because the engineers I've been teaching, I've taught myself to connect with the <unk>N. in my apartment, I want to sum up everything with an equation.
Look at your science, your discourse and your writing words, they divide through the popular, so the audience is important, and they multiply the whole thing you have for your incredible work, and that's where you can create incredible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I really love that.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can film a crime in Syria,
You can tweet a phone with a phone, and launch a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, upload it to soundCloud and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in time.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were walking on the street and showing them how to change in the road.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all these people who were coming out and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on this?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up.
Hold it up. Android, Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot of them. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about myself and my cell phone today, and how my life has changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Preading data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, E.U. We have launched a policy line.
This is a policy line called the U.S. Security Council.
The rule of the Internet is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service provider in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls who calls? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text message to whom?
And when you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And all over Europe, people were up there, and they said, "We don't want to go."
They said, we don't want to have the U.S. protection supply.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet service to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to be."
And here you can see, tens of thousands of people migrated on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Fearness instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be the turn of the Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the headblimp police in Eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is this really working?
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone, I use my phone?
So I asked my phone company, the De-HED, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information you've stored on me.
And I asked her once and asked her again, and she didn't get a right answer. Just a squatter Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life, which is tracking it.
So I decided to join a court court scene against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German Telegraph said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And it ended up with a comparison to them.
I'm going to pull back the counter to which they were asking me to send all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court mandatory decided that the introduction of E.U. line was a German law enforcement line.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD is this.
35830 lines of information.
At first, I saw it and said to me, well, it's a huge file. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life on this date.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said to myself, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make it out.
Because I want to show people what the U.S. Security Council means.
So with time and open data City, I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go ahead and forth and back.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt to C<unk>l<unk>s train, and how many calls I'm going to walk on.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then some friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you, and we have this huge network of communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who's talking to who's sending an email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the winter of 1989, had cell phones in their bag.
And the Stasi had known who was at the demonstration, and when the Stasi knew who the leader had been, that might not have happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And yet, neither did the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so many information as they can get over us, online and online.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all for a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st-century, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, you say your bosses, just because companies and government states have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral stores, rapid restaurants, Braille palms.
So the city planners meet and they're changing the name of South Central Africa, so that it's true for something else, they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Silult shops, rapid restaurants, Braille palms.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivethrus and the Drivebysy.
The thing is, the urge to kill more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles for the most sacred conditions.
So obesity rate in my neighborhood, for example, is five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't see that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you walk out of the house, you see the negative effects that are the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I've enabled the rollmill to buy and sell as a vehicle fleets.
I see dialogue centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what I have to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I also didn't feel like a pair of 45 minutes of marriage to get an apple that's not sub-connected with pesticides.
So I planted a food hotland in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the parking lot.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay in the place."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grasses, together, and we started planting my food-win and fruit trees, which is the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of pre-medential group, put together by the gardeners of all social layers and from the entire city, it's completely voluntary, and everything we're doing is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he was basically summoned me, and he said that I had to remove my garden, which was the propulsion to a constellate.
And I thought, "Come on, do you?
A conformed account for growing food in a piece of land that doesn't matter for you?
And I thought, "Cool. Her name with this."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times received wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and he talked to the city center, and with a member of Green, and she was a petition on Change.org, with 900 Signatures, we were successful.
We thought we had the victory in our hands.
My city minister even called and said they were supporting and loving what we're doing.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest plaza in the United States, the largest temple in the ownership of the city.
They have 67 miles of hardware rooms.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell shouldn't they find it OK?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
My name is my bearship, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To rebuild its own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I am more ashamed to be part of this preconventional reality that was made by other people, and I made my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
So gardenwork is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who was chilling the walls, I swear my lawn and park plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my trappings for this stuff.
They'd be surprised what the ground is all that can be done if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
They'd be wondering how kids are affected by this.
And gardening is the most therapeutic and the most powerful act that you can do, particularly in the middle of the city.
And you can get strawberries.
I remember that time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in my backyard, and I came out, and she looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason of the street."
I hated when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that made me only powerful to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum Devil, no, I'm not afraid they're clinging.
And it's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
I put a garden in the local house in D.A.
These are the guys who helped me to borrow the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how they planted their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was just for a moment.
Green Grasses have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we came to our mulches and we got 50 people and we did all of these volunteers.
If you grow a family of carbon, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get any of them, if they're not shown, how food and body influence, they're going to eat blindly, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color-like kids who are just on the path that they're looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
And I see the gardeners as a chance to train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And when we do that, who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to.
So that's one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to plant a whole residential gardening where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscontco and turn it into healthy cafeteria.
So, you know, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The cometing of sustainability is that you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and getting them the joy of honor and honorful of getting them to build their own food, and when you open up farmers' markets.
So, what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all ecological rebels, gangmen, gang gardeners.
We have to turn the image of the hallway.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gang.
You'd have to have a shower with a chim, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up in a barry chairs and want to make a meeting where you're talking about doing some clothes.
If you want to meet me, you come with your shuffle, in my backyard, so that we could plant any tracker.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "nyygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "Tnollygoster" means "a-gossest politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper host held a better definition: "Mollygasterdy is someone who is on a outcast, independent party or program or program or performance, and his success of the power of the monumental decouceptive Prince Cric.
I have no idea what the playbook is.
I think something like that.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, the British parliament had been picked up, and the newspapers didn't have the exact word of debugging in the news.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brrosby, who had been working on parliamentaries.
They threw it to the Tower of London, and he was brave enough, he was brave enough to win, and eventually he had so much support in London that he won't win.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so believe in brassif."
Brass the word for the guitar.
But that's not true. It's a secretary of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to America at the time when they've just reached independence.
And you're looking at the question of how to call George Washington, the state of state,
You didn't know.
What is the leader of an Irish nation?
and there's been an awful lot of debate in Congress about this.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions there.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his senior George Washington, and others, the conservation of the people in the United States of America, Washington.
It's not a shame.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was approved.
They were not monarchists, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored in a little bit, because this debate had three weeks on.
I read the days of a Senate that's always been writing: "Take the same topic."
The reason for the delay, and the excitement was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a kygant. They didn't want to.
And they're called, king, and they may be able to give him ideas about their success.
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most mouriest title, the most sacred title they could think of.
This was a title called "Pisord."
President. They didn't invent the title. He only meant someone was carving a gathering.
It's something like the pre-preter of a jury.
He had no longer had the term "Dear" or "Dearhing water."
Sometimes, there were little colonial people, community-makers, government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
And so the Senate refused to settle him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to sign up the treaty and meet foreign-performance officer.
Who will take him seriously when he has a stupid little title like the president of America in the United States?"
And then, after three weeks, the Senate didn't go.
Instead, you've been unaware of using the "duty" "isest" but they absolutely wanted to make sure they weren't agreed for the person who is responsible for the opinions and civil society, whether they're in the United States, whether they're in the condition, that the state is responsible for the country, not to unwill the person, and the person who is not necessarily unrelated, and the person of the world's assertant,
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One is -- and I think it's the best thing to do -- and I can't find out whether the Senate has ever been authorized formalized by the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just called the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that when a government says that something temporary -- -- you're going to wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is that the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not so humorous, right?
It's something more than 5,000 nuclear droplet, which he has, and the largest economy of the world, and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
and the truth and story have given the title of size.
And that's how the Senate ended up winning.
They have a respectable title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the ringing of self-esteem, well, it was the case.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won and the representative house lost, because no one feels humbly, if you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can carry with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but in fact, the reality changes the reality much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebellion to fight Mr. Gralalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would sit on my black Conclimate to a pair of brown leatherwale and I would train a rocket to the government frere, which I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I'd been a big time before the war, but besides Pyjama party and football game dancing at Samens and guests with crusistic South states and surriences of international demonstrations who lived in the community and lived with Afghanistan and Vienna, and he had to confuse and re-prelecord the fact that I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I think, a more fragile Afghans, South African-state Gaden, an atheist, and a radically political artist who's been working in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So, there are great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like painting rainworms. I want to make art that will fill up and trust the personality and trust and the reality and the reality itself, and even a kind of creative community to try and figure out the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in life of jihad -- westis who governs jihad against communists like <unk>-bop-Soping, and use armed religious and political corruption to enrich itself.
And what else can make jihad-firsters than to parliament and to have a choice campaign with the slogan: "Please choose me! I'm making jihad.
And to try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi who spend on national heroes.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rearing Unit," where you're a police officer, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes from them, providing money, and putting money on behalf of Kabul on them, hoping for the police to take them, and they hope that they accept 100 of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the Cropical conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was building a hives of local Afghan dressers with a protective, or some recycled torgles in a neoco-friendly, an open-endant arts effort.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan of Kabul looks like Kipling Appell to create a dialogue about the current developing African-Americans of their roots in the past colonial rhetoric about the White White White White White Dictionaries to protect the brown man themselves and perhaps even a little bit of civic.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
But I'm doing it because I have to, because the geography of self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I've been working as a model for a while.
It's been around 10 years ago, exactly.
I feel like I've built a very unconditional tension here in the room, because I wouldn't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit more change on that.
This is the first time that someone is raising on the TED stage, so you can appreciate yourself, you can see this, I think.
If there were some women who were really shooking when I came out, you don't need to tell me this one later on Twitter.
I also recognize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10-second seconds what you think of me.
And it's not the chance of all.
These are very uncomfortable tracks, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull my head's sweater over my head, because you're all going to wake me up, so you're not doing anything as long as it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also super-span.
I've just changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should throw my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And apart from surgery or the wrong thing that I've been doing two days ago, there's only very few ways of changing our utterness, and our utterness, although it's super-span and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Fearless to be, to me, is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a lovely white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the most honest way.
The first question is, "How are you going to model a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I became a model is a winning in genetic lottery and a very important legacy, and maybe you might ask yourself what this legacy is.
Well, in the past few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, in which admiration is biodegradable, but also as big, crusty, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this, and maybe some fashion agent calls, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Sman. Huh!
And first, I'm talking about your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has all been counted in the run, each single one that was being harvested, and that 677 simulations were not only six or fewer than four percent.
The next question that always asks me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, why?
You know what? You can do everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which is completely wrong, because if you were the first one."
And when they say about this great counting, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "I'm going to be the boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head of American bird flu, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like saying that you want to win the Jackor in the lottery.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a trained model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgeons, it can only be disintegrated.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo," then the leg is first, beautiful, long, long, so this arm, back to the back, is on the head, moving on the side, and you're just moving back and just just just going back, you're going to see 300, 400, 400, 400, 400 years old friends
It looks something like this.
I hope that it's less strange than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what's happened.
If you finish school and you have made a life cycle and you have a few jobs, unfortunately, you can't say much more, because if you want to be president of the United States, but you're looking at "10 years of underwear," you're going to be very strange.
The next question that's often been asked to me is, "Who are you raising all the photos?"
And yes, so much of the photos are retured, but that's just a small part of what's going on.
This is the very first photograph I've done, and that was also the very first time I'd been wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my time on that.
I know this is going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is how I just saw just a couple of months before my grandmother.
This is me the day of the Shadow.
My friend had to come with me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a bait for French birdry.
This is me with the football team and in V-C magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you see that these images aren't images of me.
They are constructives, and they are a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the FDA and reproduction. They're not me.
Okay, so next, when people always ask me, "You have things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot-cunkers I can never wear, except the things I'm willing to get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
As a teenager, I drove with my friend, a horrible driver, and they were tracking a red light, and of course it took me. It just had to say, "Excuse me, Mr. Words," and we could go on.
I've got these unconditional things because of my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay for their appearance and not paying attention to their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 140,000 teenagers who were stopped last year, and was 600 percent black and Latino and mostly young men.
There are only 177,000 young black and Latinos living in New York, who are not asking the question, "Am I stopping?"
"How often am I stopped? When am I going to quit?"
In my research, I found out that 53 percent of all 13 African girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number goes up to 78 percent when they've become 17 percent.
The last question I have to ask me is, "How is it a model to be?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a bit thin and darker hair, then you feel very happy and generous."
And we have backstage a response that might give you this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, I've never said, is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel insecure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happier if I had thin legs and darker hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool flares of the car, and they're probably the ones in their appearance, probably, most insecure women on the planet.
When I've been preparing this talk, it seems very difficult to me to move a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to sit here and say, "I've got all the benefits of a stack that's been dragged into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that doesn't make me happy."
It was very difficult to share a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the largest uses of abuse.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that before I've been here, 10 or 30 years since my career has been completely disrupted, because I would probably not tell you how my first job was taken, or I would not tell my best job, or I would not tell you how college paid so much.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our strange successes and failure.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile: "Son, gaddafi, Faddafi. Be a fight.
But never will, like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been now almost two years since the Senate, inspired by the waves of mass-war performance in both the Tunisian revolution.
I connected myself to many other Libyans, and beyond Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyrannic regime Gadadis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Young, licensed women and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, held slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
They've demonstrated some empirical courage by putting Gaddafis against the brutal dictator.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity, from far from far to far west, to the South.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to free our country and avoid the tyranny.
But Gaddafi also left a huge burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption, and the foundation of the pathology.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannic regime has destroyed both infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the ly-gian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I recognized how many other women would rebuild the civil society of Lyas, and we demanded a legal and un-public of democracy and national acalition.
Near 200 organizations, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis, started in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to the issues of human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding collection of Liby women, a movement of women, leaders of different backgrounds, whose goal is to be public, public-based, sociopolitical empowerment, and to embrace our right-being with the rights of democracy and peacebuilding.
In the case of the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and exclusion.
I led a campaign to the peacebuilding platform for women to achieve a sovereign law law, a law that would give every citizen, no matter what context to choose, and to vote, and, above all, to create a political parties between the female and female candidates, to a vertical-level, horizontal-level, horizontal-level, and to make a constant match.
and we ended up being taken over and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the national bank worker in the first 52 years since.
But long, but the euphorian had made sure, and the whole revolution, because every day we started to have new messages about violence.
And one morning we woke up on the news and we entered the news gap for the elderly and Sufi leaders.
In another morning, we received news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then another morning, the suicide bombers were signed up by the armed forces.
And indeed, we're at the leadership of the licensing and their ongoing ongoing ongoing, human prisoners and their abuses of laws and laws and laws.
Our society, composed of a revolutionary mind, polarized, distant from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which they were at the beginning.
Intent, rejection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our discourse and the elections.
I'm actually here today to confess that we, as a nation, have made false choice and wrong choices.
We've been wrong with our priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or security in cash shops.
Did the hardest and change between women and male leaders have made peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate the culturally-cented politics and the banal, both men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only thing to miss, but the female values of compassion, the gade and the discomfort.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus that required it as the elections that ultimately strengthens the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female, more than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of anger and demand a day of revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gade.
We have to develop a female discourse that is not only empowering the values, but also to include: Gadeess, instead of working, instead of lacking a competition, instead of an intentional.
These are the ideals that need to be fought by war, that need to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has an alchemie and in this alchemie, it's about the cross-cating of feminine and masks of view.
That's the real punching.
And we have to do that in some ways before we do it sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam" -- peace, "is the word of the Good God, pier, pier."
The word "raveem" again, which is known in all the latehamian traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rahem" -- "to-to-in-in-law, symbolically symbolically the female surrounding the whole humanity, the male and the female, all the tribes and all the peoples have been out of the world.
And just like the mother rappor, which grows in his embryo, is so much of a free-hearted sense of compassion that's ever the existence.
And that's why we were told, "My Gade always puts things in."
And that's why we were told, "My Gnade has preignated from my fortune."
We're all going to be the wes of the Gade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up practicing the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were tracking the story of Kim Il's history, but we didn't learn much about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are enemies.
And while I often wondered how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all the changing time.
At age seven, I saw a public extension for the first time, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to never suffer to hunger myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter, a sister of mine.
And they said, "If you were listening to this, our five family members will not be here for the world, because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
And I was just on the train, and I was walking over the train, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A squad drowned woman on the ground, and a pentper-to-washing kid in her arm was smelling helpless in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because they were all busy taking care of themselves and their families.
In the mid-'99s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were enjoying the victims, and many more people survived because they ate grass, beetles and celaline.
and the powerfalls have become increasingly common, so that at night, everything was worse, except the lights of China on the other side of the beetle we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Ampont, which is part of the river between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vigorously and enabled North Koreans to escape.
A lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the devastating years of famine to the relatives of China.
I just thought I was separated for a short time from my family.
I never thought it would take us 14 years to work again.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as a North American refugee. But I soon learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Carolina's refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
And one day, my biggest nightmare was recognized when I was caught by the Chinese police department and sent to the police station.
And someone accused me to be Northern Koreans, so they tested my Chinese names and made me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
And if anything unnatural appeared, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made it my emotions and I answered the questions.
And after they finished the poll, a official said to the other one: "That was a wrong thing.
It's not Northern Ireland."
They let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are collecting messages for foreign Asyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released because of tremendous international printing.
These North Koreans didn't have so much fortune.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans in China, and they're released to North Korea, where they're tortured, imprisoned or re-loved.
Although I had been lucky enough to escape, there are many other North Koreans who don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle for survival.
and after they've learned a new language and work, their world can be replicated in a moment in time.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was to escape in South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I would have thought.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start my third language.
And I also realized that the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of us we've been very diverged by a partial basis, because of 67 years.
I went through a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstore?
Where am I coming from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't fall easy, I had a plan.
I prepared for the recording test at university.
Just as I became a little more normal, I got a shock call when I was a new life call.
The North Carolina regime started the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family forced to relocate to a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as rapidly as possible, so I started to plan for escape.
North Koreans have to come back to an incredible track to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself on the road to the North Poleline.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, more than 2,000 miles across China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got nearly several times caught.
Once, when the bus was held up, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the criteria of all of them, and he started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I decided to come up and told him that they were child-in-fitch, and I was a her boss.
He looked at me. He laughed at me, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to get to the Portuguese border, but I had to go out almost all my money to bribe the borderline of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated, because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and bakery fees, my family was released within a month, but for a moment, my family was rebelted back, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest disregulations of my life.
I've done everything to protect my family to freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Carolina poster.
I went and I went between the immigrant agency and the police department, trying to free my family, but I had no money to pay for the bribe or money.
I lost all my hope.
And the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is busy.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without complaining, he went to a bank engine, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about the whole heart, and I said, "Why help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The former stranger who came to me was symbolized to a new hope that the North Koreans desperately need, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I, again, united in South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Most North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn to learn in education, the education of English, the professional education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family support, and we're sending them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I had such lucky luck to get as much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make hopeful North Koreans to succeed with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide it, and he's going to divide it.
It's not rosy. It's not for the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and he's just telling you, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to be about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown needs to be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It has absolutely unknoodd memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate fries, but he remembers the publication of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the first result of the teapleties on my arm was to have my arm on my arm to beat my granddad and Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the social version of normal, they often have been understood and wrong.
But what motivated my heart and my soul was that, although that was the case, even though they weren't considered to be normal, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compatism," it's a complex psychiatric disorder of the brain that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's a different feature for each individual, so Remi is so different from Sam.
And the world's been increasingly identified every 20 minutes in a new person of autism, and although one of the fastest growing diseases in the world is the world, there is no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember it without remembering it.
I was only three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was screaming a lot.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and set up his own world with his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a row, to attract the washing machine and eat everything that came out of it.
And as he got older, he was different and the differences were visible.
But behind the razor and the Frelty and the never-discovered hyperactivity, something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being who never had ever been done.
It's extraordinary.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the thoughts that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these things I wouldn't want to trade against normalality.
But the naturality is the beauty that tells us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there is a different kind of right.
And if I could only tell you one thing to Remi and Sam and to you, it would not be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody of us has a gift. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The opportunity for scale, progress and change dies at the moment when we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Doc Edveron has filled with us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph on a project of an apple and a unit of radiation just a million seconds ago.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world with a million or a billion images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new imaging technology that is so fast that it can create slow motion-time-time-surpature footage.
And so we can build cameras that are out of our view, looking out at corners, or without a <unk>-ray image in your body, and really ask what we're doing with the camera.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I zoom it in a billionth of a second -- these are several parts of the second -- I create a package of photons that is barely a millimeter wide, and this photonodiac, this project, will move at the speed of light, and, as I said, a million times faster than a product.
So, if you take this project, this photons pack, and you put it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event.
So, think about this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanotapap -- so long enough to take the light back -- but I need to slow this video to make the factor 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what's going on.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photonodite pack, which starts to move through and eventually break into the inside.
And part of the light ishesing out to the table, and you see the wave of waves.
and many of the photons eventually reach the shock of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of a bubble that's floating around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and you take it back the same track, and you can slow the video back to 10 billion, you know, how long do you have to sit here to see the film?
One day, a week? No, a year.
This would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about something still-time photography?
You can see again, like the waves of the table, the Tomate and the wall on the back of the screen.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the natural world would paint this picture, each of which is a femto image, but of course our eye is a collection of images.
But if you look at these Tomatees again, you'll see that when the light is streaming down, the light goes back, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomrow is mature, and the light jumps around in your house and it comes back for a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if these trucks are built in your camera in your Camerahandy, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if there's a fruit, without touching any one.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you're doing a picture of a short-term radiation period, you've got very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than the shortest air record, so you're going to get your light at all.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons pack, and we're drawing this, we're going to do it again, with very clever synchrony synchrony, and we're combining this gigabytes of data, and we're actually doing this, to create these milemto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what if it were a new superpower for a future superheroes, could be able to see corners?
The idea is that we're turning a light on the door.
It's going to be crushing into the room, and part of it will be reflected back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could exploit this multi-folded pattern of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left side, you see our FemtoM camera.
The back of the wall is hidden and we're going to be able to break the light off of the door.
After our paper was released in theNature Communications, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created these animation.
We're going to chop up this light project and we're going to be able to put it back into this wall and this photons pack, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup, which will break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the light from the light, and a tiny fraction of the photons will then come back to the camera, but it will be very interesting in a very different time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time-solving system, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of distance is.
By illuminating a laser, we can take a raw image that -- how you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we record a lot of these images, dozens of these images, and we're trying to analyze the different light walls, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've also got a little bit to do, before we can make this work out of the lab, we could build cars that avoid collisions, and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous levels of survivors, by looking at light, by bouncing through the window, or we can build final milidos that can see deep into the body, to see the right-hatch, and also to the barchill.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, that's very challenging, and that's why this is really a wake-up call for scientists, we can now think about Ftoto- photographer, because a new imaging tool can actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like a few seconds, a scientist, even a scientist, has become a art, a art of the ultra-fifth photography, and I realized that all of that gigabytes of data we're collecting every single time, we're not just using the scientific process, we can also create a new form of a computer, a new kind of photonapomy, with paint, with paint, and we can just look at the wave of time, and we can't
But it's something that happens here.
And when you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost at the speed of light, we've had weird effects, and Einstein would love to see this picture incredibly.
So the order of taking place in the world is going to appear in a camera in reverse order, so by applying the specific relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So, whether it's about photography around us or building a new imaging of medicine or new exhibitions since we've been able to open all the data and hope that the "innership" and the challenge that we want to be creative and the research community to show us that we should stop ourselves from the megapapars to the next dimension -- to the next-to-to-to-frame, to the next-to-to-to-frame, to the next
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our people can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street, so that there's a lot of wisdom that we're not passed, but we're using the same public spaces.
Over the past few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and scoops and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, like how much renting my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is chased by the huge eel, which for hundreds of years have been loved, drunk and trauma, and I trust a city where music is always available.
I think every time someone never ever ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are also the city with most of the abandoned houses in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how I could get it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me, and her death suddenly came out and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I've been able to feel a great gratefulness for my life, and it's been a very clear way to me about the things that are important to me in life.
But I'm hard to keep this view on the daily basis.
It's easy to lose your daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a side of the house into a giant board and I wrote a bridge of the gaps, "We want to die, I want to die," everyone who can come back, take a piece of chalk, think about their lives and share their hopes in this public.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled, and it grew and grew.
I want to share with you some sentences written by the people on the wall.
"I wish I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'd like to die before I'd like to be a broad-length over the International Crisis line."
"I wish I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I wish I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I wish I die, I want to live sub-verbally."
"I wish I die, I want to keep her in my arms once."
"I wish I die, I want to be a pavic painting."
"I wish I die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of the people brought me to laugh, to wine, and to fuse me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and obvious way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what is most important as we grow and changing.
I've taken this last year and received hundreds of news from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a construction kit, and now in the world today, in Kazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to rise and share our voices with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often held up by talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthen most of us.
The idea of death shows us the life.
Our common spaces are the best important to us as individuals and as community, and with more opportunities, to share our hopes, our fears and stories, that people around us can not only help us create better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in aggressive mathematics. A special problem for anyone who's been involved in aggressive mathematics is that we're like business managers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try and tell you what I do.
And dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're excited about the sight of the Danish Ballett and the graders, as you're going to see in the same way.
And the ballet is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and potentially a basic signal that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability, which also makes it to my bosses of Schripling, who was a balletomy at the time.
Over the years, we've been doing a lot of progress in treatment.
And yet, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the most intractable symptom, sword, killings, killness, and others, that cause that disease, so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We have to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only possibility to know is whether there is cure, if we have a objective metric that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there is no other movement of Parkinson's disease, and other ways of doing biomarkers, so you can't do simple blood analysis. What's the best thing that's in this 20-minute test that's in neurologists.
You have to do it in the clinic. It's very expensive, and that means that outside clinical trials, it's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would make a trained tour to save the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't have to be expensive hospital users.
It's 300 percent, by the way, that's in the neurologic unit.
And so I want to propose to you that an unconventional way that we're trying to achieve this, because we're all, at least, virtual, virtual nuos like me, as the Asesler, Janppriple.
This is a video of vibrating vocal tipping.
This is what happens in the normal state, when someone's voice sounds, we can look at the common ballet dancers, because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs when we're creating the sounds, and we've all got the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And it requires a lot of practice, like ballet.
Think about how long a child needs to learn to speak.
By the way, we can determine the position of vibrating vocal tapes, and the limbs are also the mood of Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom panel, you can see an example of irregular vocal evidence.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Bad, weakness, cphemity.
The language is even more aged and refreshing, and that's an example of the character for it.
And this effects of the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and risk analysis, combined with new machine learning that's advanced now, we can now find where someone is in a cucoxic disease between disease and health, just because of the vocal tone.
So how can we measure these testing with clinical trials? Well, they're not the non-invasive. The test is given to the neurologists.
They're not good. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build a new clinics for that.
And both are exactly the same. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very quick, very high-forward 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If there's something extremely cheap, you can use it in a very large scale.
And this amazing goals that we can do now.
We can reduce logistics problems for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from common observation.
We can do cheap mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we can do it for the first time in the entire population.
We now have the possibility to look for biomarkers before it was too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's dilemma.
With Aculab and patient's home, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data to provide the targets.
We have a call "bars" that are three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who has been using or without Parkinson's, can be properly nominated for a couple of cents, and I'm announcing that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of, say, do you take 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happening is that the patient has to tell you that the patient has to have to tell you whether this person has suffered from Parkinson's Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to end up.
But what we do is we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions matter, because we are able to choose to figure out which is the actual marker for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is their right?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to blame him because he's been doing such amazing work -- has now shown that it's working on the cellular network, which is what makes this project possible, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a more improvement.
That is, people can call people the phone, and they can call the test, and they could call people with Parkinson's, they can send their voice, so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see my father's cows behind the kitchen, and the mine is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the South, in fact, a small incite, and that means that wildlife can be dumped in the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning and I found her dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buock.
My tribe, the tribe of the Massai, believes that we came together with our animals and the habitat of the sky, and that's why our animals mean to us so much.
I was a kid when I was a kid to hate lions.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our treasures. They're also taken for this problem.
They kill lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years old is responsible for his father, so that's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us, but also helping the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't stand up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the bird, they go back and they go back. And the next time, they come, and they say, the thing doesn't move, that's still there.
and they grab the nest and kill our livestock.
One night, I missed the ravel. I walked around with a torch with a torch, and this time the lions didn't catch up.
And the lions fear light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
I was working as a young boy all day in my room, and I even took the new radio of my mother, and the day, she taught me about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a driver of a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn to the left or left. It blinks.
And I made a switch to turn the lights and turn the lights off.
This is a little pearne from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built all of these together.
The solar panel invites the battery, which provides a battery of electricity to the grid. I call it a transformer.
And the driver's policy is blinking.
You can see that the saves are outwards, because the lions come from there.
And this is what the lions look like when they come.
The lights flashing and the lions believe I'm walking around the bar, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and since then, we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
They lost a lot of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. They can see lions in the background.
I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're doing pretty well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, also for other predators like hymen or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helps by fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in together where there is no one, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
A year ago, I was just a boy who was eating cows from the savanna, and my father was eating airplanes about me, and she said, "I'm going to be sitting in one of them!"
And here I am.
I was invited to create a plane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to play lions. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and the lions. We can live side by side with lions, without any argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, "I appreciate you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you listen to.
So you have this scholarship now. Yes.
You work on other electric inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electric fence. An electroconceic?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- Yeah, I tried to do this, but I've been given a little bit of a little bit of a while, because I got a blow.
The very beginning is hard. Richard Turder, you're kind of special.
We're going to hire you every step of your house, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I'd like to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of executive, no style, no chance of shooting a picture. Not even studying the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourist tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife made this picture, where I held my daughter on my first birthday, and we were at the corner of 57 and fifth.
And just a year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going on --
When my daughter's third birthday came to me, my wife said, "Hey, why do you not go to New York and do a father's daughter's first-daughter's Day, to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking tourists to come and make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're having a complete stranger with your camera.
No one ever said no, and fortunately, no one has ever been fooled with our camera.
And at the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just a couple of weeks taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a hidden moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us to take place in October, to stop time and change our time and how we're going to change our way of year, not just physically, but in everything.
Although we're always doing the same image, our perspective changes as time as they're moving new milestone, I can see life with their eyes, as they deal with everything and how it sees.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value and expect for a year.
And recently, during one of our trips, we walked out and suddenly they were breaking down like this, and it shows a red tracker on a dolls, which they learned as a little kid, in the earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old about this particular place.
She said she remembered her heart of her chest when she first saw the store for the first time.
And now they look at them in New York City to schools, because they really want to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we're creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm hardly nearly a family photograph.
I'm always the one who makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image and ask you not to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 25.98, 56.9/33.5/21.2/13.4 (BP=0.959, ration=0.959)
