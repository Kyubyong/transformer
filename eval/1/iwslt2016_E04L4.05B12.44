When I was seven years old, I was a morning of the songs of the songs.
My father heard about his little, high-speed radio, the news of the National House.
He saw a very happy thing about what was, because he was very unusual for the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone."
I didn't know what that meant, but it was also obvious to my father, very happy.
"Look, you can go to a real school school," and he said, "S,
This morning, I never forget.
That's a real school.
The Taliban of power in Afghanistan, when I was six girls, and they were not too married to school.
So I was so afraid of five years old, and my older sister had not been able to go back to a school school school.
and so we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to do it, so nobody could go.
We're looking at our books in a lot of books, so it's like we're going to go to the street.
We were in a house, about 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a very cold, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we had our lives: teachers, students, parents and parents.
And then, for a week, the classroom had to be out of a week, because the Taliban had to be angry.
We were never sure how much they knew.
Are they going to have them?
Did you know where we live?
We had fear, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a great privilege to grow in a family in education, as a matter, and they were born.
My grandfather was far more.
A border from a farm in Ghana, and he was in the country, her mother, her mother -- and he was sent to school and his father.
My mother was a teacher, but the teacher was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she was in the prison, just to put our house in school and women's house and women's village.
And my father -- you see, first of his family, who had a education school.
It was obvious to me that your kids were going to have a education, despite their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all of the risks.
He saw a much larger risk to send kids to school.
I know exactly exactly exactly the same thing that I was so frustrated by the Taliban, and I was so frustrated by our life, fearing, and the intercurity.
I mean, I'm good enough to pay attention, but my father said, "Dold, I can go in your life.
You can't buy money. You can be thrown out of the war.
But one thing is that you're going to always be, and if we're in your blood, we're going to pay attention to your lunch school, we're going to do that.
So, you're going to ask you to get out of that?
Today, I'm 12 years old.
I grew up in a country where the discovery of war was destroyed.
Less than six percent of my life, I was a higher age than the high school, and when my family were so so vulnerable, I would have to be a lot of my education, I would have to do this women.
Instead of all, I'm here today, as a bit of the Sistine School of the New Yorker.
When I went to Afghanistan, my grandfather was the ones that were beaten by his family, because he was forced to send his daughter to school to send her daughter to the first one of the ones that I would be the ones who were.
He doesn't just do it with my career, but also I was the first woman, and it was the first woman who was with the car.
My family believe me.
I have great dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global campaign for 10 percent of the world's campaign for women's education.
So I've helped to build, MO: MO: So the first way that I was a nonprofit school student in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, in a country, in fact, the school, it's a lot more effective.
It's wonderful to see how students are in school, with high-tech, they're all interested in their own lives.
And to see how their parents and their parents were, as I was in the way, my parents, and despite all of them, they were all the way to do.
Like the prison. That's not really the name, and I can't show you, but the father is my student.
A month ago, her daughter was in the home of Long Maps, and she was in her village, and she was a bomb from the street to the street, and they're only about a few minutes.
And when he went home, the phone was sent to the phone, and a voice would give him his daughter to school, and then she would try to do it.
And he said, "You know, if you want to do that, I'm not going to play the future of my daughter's favorite-time-being."
In Afghanistan, I've found something that's going to be in the West, which is often a little bit more likely to tell us, which is a father who is the father who is the cause of his daughter, and that's the reason that it's success.
It's not going to be called our mothers's role in success.
In fact, they're often interested in the ones that are highly compelling, and they're very serious for their own generation, but in a society, as a society, and as the women are responsible for the women's rights.
The Taliban were only a few girls in school, because it was illegal.
Today, in Afghanistan, about three million girls in the school school.
Afghanistan is looking at America, so different.
Americans recognize how the changes are.
I'm sure that the changes are not long, and they're all over the U.S.S.S.S. people's population changes.
But when I was in Afghanistan, when I see students in school, and their parents, they are helping them to do it, I see a very compelling future and a world.
Afghanistan was one country, and the hope of hope and hope, and remember every day, the U.S.S.
And that's how we have great dreams.
Thank you very much.
All I do is, I do, also, a life -- I was born from seven years ago, as a young woman.
In 1976, I see it in 1974, I see young, but I'm not -- I'm in Kenya, in Kenya, in Kenya, the University of Uganda, and the projects of the projects with countries.
I was working in Italian M.S. and every single project that we were doing in the legs.
I was very hard.
I was 20 years ago, we thought we're good people, and we're good work in Africa.
Instead of what we killed everything we did.
So our first project, what my first book was called "Bre" in Sood, who was a journalist that we wanted to show people how food is going to be used to be used to eat food.
We came to Japanese-American cell-sized cell-Americans in the South, in the middle of the S.S., which we've been studying the local communities of the country and the Asian elephant and the French and the French and the al-S.
Of course, the international authorities had no interest to work, so we were working for work, and sometimes they were also in the work.
We were surprised to be a kind of non-freated agriculture.
But instead of asking, why don't they do anything, we said, "Oh, thank you, we're here."
"Tve to save people in the world's S<unk>aeda."
Of course, all of the wonderful things in Africa.
We had this strong fat-tic soup. In Italy, they were so big, so it was so big.
We couldn't believe, and they said, "Look, how agriculture is."
When the fruit and the red and the red, we came out of about 200 miles from the river, and all the things went out.
We said, "Oh God, God, the "Oh, the haw!"
And they said, "Yes, why don't we have agriculture."
"Why don't you have said to us?" "You never have."
I just thought we were a great, very good-scale, but I looked at the Americans who were doing what the English group were doing, and I looked at what I was doing.
We actually used the pest.
You should see the air -- you should see the air that we don't have to do anything about African African people.
You should read the book "Mo" from Toooooooo, and they're a nonprofit scientist.
The book was published in 1996.
We've given the African continent of a billion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been.
Just read the book.
You know, you know, a African, what we've been doing.
We are social rights, the main, the main, the mission, and there are two species, and we're doing it, we're doing it. We're in the way we're doing it, we're a national, or we're the same-being.
Both words are from the Latin of the green, "w," which means "wood" means.
But they have two different things.
Leolic: I'm doing every culture, as if they were my kids, "I love you."
Patos: I'm doing every culture, as if they were my bossy.
So the white white people in Africa are called "wood, the boss,
I was a moment when I read the book "wood""-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-"-w-s-s-s-s-s-"-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-"-the-the-the-century, he said, if people don't want to go in.
That's the first principle of help.
The first one is the responsibility.
Now, tomorrow, the conference, who was doing this conference, a wall, and she said, "Can you imagine a city of the city?"
When I was a year, I decided to be in order to respond to people, and we had a system called the National government, which is never going to be done, and you're never going to be a little bit of the local local, local local local local, local, local, the local community, the local community, the people who are willing to be a better person.
You do what you do. You're making the mouth.
You never have to do with ideas, you're going to connect with the community.
We're not working on the office.
We're going to make a lot of the cafeteria. We're in a box.
We have no infrastructure.
We're looking at a friend of experiences and find what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can make a idea of it.
If this person is not like what you do?
The power of its growth is the most important thing.
The work for your own life is the most important part of humanity.
We help them find knowledge, because nobody can't be successful.
The person who didn't have the idea, but it's available.
A lot of years ago, I had this one of my mind: Why not to come into a community and tell people what they're trying to hear, why don't we do it?
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community groups.
Not a society has never been told, and they're never going to say what they want to do with their money, what they see.
And that's a place that has a certain position.
The best people in the community are not because they never never have to speak public public education.
We're working in a way to do this, a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new work is created.
This is the house of the company, the family of the community, with you, with your house, in the kitchen, and the cafes are in the supermarket, and they can find the help you find a life in a way.
I've done it in the world, West, trying to work.
I was trying to do it for time, trying to say, we're going to say other other things that they're supposed to do.
And so I went back to the first year, and in the first three days, I met them in a garage, and I was in a garage, and I was to sell him in a house, and I was to buy a restaurant, and I said, "You know, you know, you know, I'd have to help you do that."
I've been working on those five fish, and these wonderful sharks are not in a factory in San Francisco, for example, but for example, I said, "Mo, I'm a dollar, and then you've got to help me, and you're asking me, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you're helping me?"
In a year, I was in a year, I was going to go to ask, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I do something very difficult?
I feel the mouth and listen to them."
So -- so the government says, "Okay, let's take it back."
We've done in 300 communities in Kenya.
We've been working in 500 companies in the organization.
There's a new generation of companies that are about loneliness.
So, the first company, one of the best companies, died with a hundred years ago.
So, the first thing was that a researcher of philosophy, before he started with companies, he said, "D., design is really a reality in a society and society."
So, the death is the death of leadership.
So you're building a tradition of being able to know what the best person is to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get it to you.
You have to help them and privacy and privacy, you need to help them, and they're going to be re-dated.
In a community of 10 people, we're going to take 200 companies.
Can you imagine a community of about 400 people, the intelligence and the passion?
Now, for the TED Talk, you're probably going to have a lot of time before tomorrow?
"Hake, passionate people. You've got this.
I want to say that leadership is the right way.
We are at the end of the first revolution, we're in the first revolution, we're going to have bio-tech, automation, and suddenly, we're still not sustainable systems.
The control system is not sustainable.
The design of the non-interest is not sustainable.
We're going to look at how we can use seven billion people in a sustainable environment, and we can use them with them and they can do them with them.
We don't have the technologies.
Who is going to create this technology in the green revolution? Are you?
The government? Do you stop!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're now now.
I read a great story in a scientific magazine in a recent study.
There was a group of experts who were invited to be the future of New York to 15 years ago.
In 18 years, they came together and they were going to be re-dated, what would happen in the New York City, and the conclusion was a non-century city.
Why? Because the curve looked at the curve, if the population is growing up, they needed to get six million eggs to people who were impossible, and it would be impossible to be done with six million pounds.
Because they were sitting in the crap.
In 18 years, they see the dirty technology that lives in New York City.
What? In the United States, after that, there were 100 dollars in the United States, 100 dollars.
The idea of technology, a different technology, had done it. There was small factories in the middle of the forest.
The S.S. Ghana, Henry II.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be trained by the mainness.
And they're not going to talk about them and talk to you.
So, next, you have to do a completely powerful, and you have to support and respect.
And then you have to tell them the truth of leadership.
So, for the very small company, the biggest company has to be able to sell three things: the product is to sell the product, the market needs to be a global and the financial revolution.
Do you guess?
We never have a single person who's doing it, and they can sell money to the money.
That's not something that we don't exist.
This person was never born.
We've done research research, and we've looked at 100 of the world's world companies -- T, the National Gates, the companies, Google, Google, Google.
There's only one thing that the successful companies have been, not one person.
We're now teaching a 15-year-old student in the South Bronx, and we're starting to try to give them the first two two two principles of the C-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-s" as the same word "I" and the word "I's" is the same as the
No one is "w" and 21."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody did a company. No one.
So we can create a community that has a small virtual background, a small virtual background, and you're sitting in the cafes, and you're going to get your bossy, and you're going to do it for someone who's talking about it, you know, you're talking about it.
What? What do you do?
Okay, so you can sell it? Can you pay money to the money?
"Oh, no, that can't I do." "I mean, I think you're thinking for you?"
We're using communities.
We've developed groups of companies that are helping the companies to help them, and we've found that the intelligence system is going to change the social system, and that the culture can be changed, and that's the culture can be changed, and that's what the world can do, and that's the power of the world, the way that is the power of the world, the world, the power, the power, the power, the way.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how to be, Alice, who is going to be in the middle of the country.
The University of University asked me -- a brand for communication -- to create programs in communication.
I was scared.
That is true. We're afraid of these students with their large and their big books and their big books, not me.
But as the conversation has developed, it was like, as Howard did, when she was walking down to the river, and a new world.
I felt like I was talking about students, and I was fascinated by the idea that they wanted to find out that other people were going to find this idea.
I think that the door is to open, it's got great communication.
We need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the problems that are the problems of energy, health, health, health, and if we don't know it, and we don't understand it, but I think we're going to think that we're going to talk about it, and that's why we're talking about these issues.
But this great conversation is that if our scientists and scientists don't tell us what they're in their own country.
So scientists and engineers, please, let's go back to us.
I want to show you a couple of things that you can do, we can see that science and technology, and that's a great thing to do with you, and it's really exciting.
The first question you have to answer them: Are you?
So let's tell us why your scientific research is so positive for us.
Don't just tell us that their pars are, but they say that their pelels, their bodies, the structure of bone, the bone, because they study it, because they can understand it, and to treat depression.
And when you tell that what they do, then you have a lot of arguments.
Now, the key is a mechanism for understanding your mind.
I mean, you know, you know, you can't use your own and do it for the time, but why don't you just say, "T" and what is it that we do?
We're trying to understand our idea, not just how to put it in the level of their way.
As Einstein said, "Lake things like this, and it's just possible."
You can't tell you about your scientific field, without having to deal with it.
Now, some things are important to explain: examples and ideas, and they can be in your hands.
And if you're trying to work your work, then let's take the numbers away.
Have you ever asked me, why is it the point?
What happens when someone is going to be asked by a different person, and with those points, you're going to see your audience.
So the slide is not just boring, but it's also about the work of the very common system, and it's very quickly to be very quickly and we're doing it.
So this is an example of genes of genes, which is very powerful. They're looking at the structure of the structure that's so powerful, that it's so powerful that it's actually the inspiration of the design of the museum.
The trick here is, a single sentence, to use the audience, to the audience, if it can be able to turn it back, and then the images can actually be able to turn the images and the same, and also the other things that makes us feel a difference.
These are just a few ways that help us open the door and the wonder of the world, and the science that we can see in technology and technology.
The engineers that I taught, who taught me to create the "S" in my own room, I want to make a prediction.
So, from your science, your data and your search, you can take your focus, and you're looking at the conversation, and what is important, and it's important to do with your work, and you've got a lot of work, and you've got to do that, you're going to have a new set of ideas that are going to do.
So scientists and engineers, if you have this equation, you know, I've been interested in it.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
You can see a cell phone in the world where you can actually go to the knowledge of humanity.
You can take a cell phone and you can go to a conversation in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can actually be careful in the sound and be famous.
All of that is a cell phone.
I'm in 1999.
So let's go back to this city in this city.
You can see how many thousands of people were coming from the street and they were walking.
We are in the early 1980s, and we're looking at all of these people who were coming from and they had a cell phone.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Just take it up.
Do you want to take your phones, you're up.
Take it up. A game, a game, a game, sorry.
That's many. Almost all of you have a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about it.
This is 35 degrees of data.
Data.
And why are these information?
In summer, the 1950s are coming up. The top has a focus on the top.
This is the main line of the state of the state of the state.
So the main line is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet, every Internet, every state of the entire Europe, has to use a range of the performance.
Who is the guy who is going to send the email?
Who is the text of a text?
And if you use a cell phone, where you are.
All of this information is going to be used for six months of your phone, or your web, or your web network.
And everywhere in Europe, people were like, and they said, "We don't want to."
They said, we want to be able to do this,
We want to be in the digital age of the digital world, and we don't want to be the phone and the Internet and the Internet, we need to deal with all of these information.
There were doctors, journalists, who said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how many people on the streets of the streets were from the West, and they said, "Tood, fear."
And some people would say that this could be called the S.D.
The dance was the pistian in the Arab East.
And I'm asking myself, whether that really works.
Can you really do that information in our way?
I'm going to use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the U.S., the biggest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them to ask them all of the information that you've been doing.
And I asked them, and then she didn't have the right answer. It was just a second. It was a lot of light.
And then I said, I want to do this information because it's my life, it's your life.
So I decided to put a report on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the Great Re-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D. said, we're going to give you this information.
and then at the end of it, it was about a comparison.
I'm going to take the pressure back to the rest of what they've asked me to get information.
Because in the meantime, the rating agencies decided that the introduction of the E.S.S.S., the top line was to be the name of the English.
So I got this horrible, and I got to put it up with a CD.
And on the right, this is.
Seven-four lines on information.
And first, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge photo. My name.
But then I realized, for a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this event.
So I was a bit more curious, what would I start with this?
Because you see where I am in night, where I'm sitting at night, what I do.
And then I said, I want to go back to this information.
I want them to do it.
Because I want to show people what the state is called the state.
So with time, online and data, I've done this.
This is a animation of six months of my life.
You can go in and see, you can go back and go back and go back and go back.
You can take a step, so I'm going to take it back.
And you can see, as I was talking about Frank Frank, who was going to go to the train, and how many doctors I do.
So all of this is possible to do this information.
That makes a bit of fear.
It's not just about me.
It's all about us.
So first, it's just my wife and she's calling me and she's telling me about a couple of time.
And then I'll give you some friends and they call them each other.
And after a while, you call them, and you're called them, and we've got this huge system.
But you can see how people are interacting with each other, they're going to call them a different word, when they're going to go to bed.
You can see all of them.
You can see the central figures that are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a building of countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design process, as you can see a society, because you know who who is talking about who is going to send a email, so that's possible to do that information.
And that information is going to be used for six months, in Europe, to two years.
So, as I first said, we're looking at all of these people in the streets of the Amazon in the early 1980s,
And the songs were supposed to know who was in the process, and when the guerrillas were, the leaders who were, would never have that.
The case of the museum was not going to be seen.
And then not only the case of the river, the slime mold.
Because today, the international sector and companies want to make so much information as they can go and go online,
They want to be able to make the opportunity to make our lives, and they want to make it much more time.
But self-interest is a life-term life in the modern age, not a contradiction.
But you have to fight the self-interest.
They need to fight every day.
So, so if you go home, you're going to say that your friends are a privacy problem, and that's not the old age.
And when you go home, you say, you're going to say, because companies have the opportunity to use a lot of information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone phone to the information that you've done.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you're going to fight yourself to be the self-dimensional future.
Thank you.
I live in Southeast.
This is Southeast Southeast, high-tech, high-tech, open-powered, local,
So the city is going to change the name, and then the name of South Bronx, so it's about it, and it's a different way to change it in San Francisco, and it's going to change if it's going to happen.
This is South California.
Tooding, high-tech, high-tech, open-hads.
So, in the way, two million Americans live in the food of the California City, San Francisco, the home of the house, the Dr.S. and the Dr.
The main is that Dr.S. the Dr.S. people are more people than the Dr.S.
People are dying in Southeast City, in the early-century diseases.
The obesity rate of my neighborhood is about five times more than the S.S., which is about 30 miles.
I couldn't have more.
And I asked myself, how do you feel if you had to have access to food, if you're going to go home, if you're going to go home, you see the effects of the system that would be the most powerful, the power of the food system has gone to their food system.
I've been trying to sell the box and sell it as a waste.
I see the arts spaces of the way that I'm going to go to the Amazon.
And I realized that the stop.
I was trying to make the problem is.
food is food and food is the solution.
And I didn't have to get more fun about the short-term, to get a apple to get a apple, not to get the crop.
So I was using a food food food house in my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park.
It's about three feet. It's about three feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to make it.
So I think, "D.D. I can do what I want to do, because I have to be responsibility, and I need to go in it."
And I decided to put it in the way.
So I came and I was the group, the T.S. T.S. and we started to build food and fish, and we're going to plant all the software, so the program, all the way, the software, all the way, the software, all the software,
We're a kind of a kind of business group, together from all of the social and all of the city, it's completely open, and we're doing everything, we're free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then you're going to have somebody.
The city came to me and he was a bit of a waste, and he said, I have to go to my backyard, and it was a set of a discourse.
And I thought, "Okay, really, really?
There's a set of control in food care on a country that doesn't care?
And I thought, "D. M.B.<unk>s for that."
Because that time, it wouldn't be on.
The T.S. Times came out of the wind. Steve L.C. and talked about a story about a city of Chicago and a local, and they were at the top of the city, and we were very successful, and we were at the top of the time, we were successful and we were at the time.
We were looking at the battle in the hands.
My city, and he said that they are helping us and love what we do.
So why do they do not do that?
Dr.S. in the United States, most of the most local workers in the city.
They're using 100 miles of the building.
This is 20east Park.
This is enough area to plant about 80 million eggs.
Why is it that the hell should not find it?
You can get a plant of a plant, you're going to take 10,000 seeds.
and in green, you're going to get a dollar of dollars and you're going to eat and eat them in the cost of 50 dollars.
It's my partner, I'm saying people are going to eat their own food.
His food is used to use their own money as their own money.
Look, you see, I've been a legacy in Southeast.
I grew up there. I was the ones I've been in there.
And I'm more interested in this idea of reality, one of the other people that were designed by people and I'm using reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
I'm working with my art. I'm working in art.
It's like a dance artist, the walls, the walls, I'm going to build and I'm using open-towning spaces.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff and the plants and the trees are my way to do this.
They were surprised to be aware of what the Earth could be doing when you use it through the screen.
You can't imagine how amazing a sun is, and how people feel.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was taken to the education and the development of my city.
To change the community, you have to change the flow of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would have been wondering how kids are affected.
So, the most common and the most powerful skill you can do, especially in the city.
You can also get more fruit flies.
I remember this time, as a mother, and her daughter came up, it was about 10 minutes ago. They were in my backyard, and I looked at them, and I looked at them.
I felt really bad, because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't do that.
The garden is not the reason in the street."
I was feeling out of it, when I saw people who were so angry, and it was just me to do it, and I said, "You know, you're not afraid to eat food." You're not going to eat food."
And I said, "No, no, no, I'm afraid of what they're doing.
And that's what it is, but it's about the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it back, but at the same time, I want them to go back to your health."
I took a room in this room in the neighborhood of the poor in T.A. in the studio.
These are the guys that helped me to put the board.
It was cool, and they changed their stories, and they changed how they were, and they were, and it was great to see her mother and see it as it was, even if it changed, it could be a moment.
So the Great Tolas have already been over 20 miles.
So to our way, we've been talking about the people, and they're working with them, and they're all the work.
When kids eat drugs, kids eat hydrogen sulfide.
When they eat fruit meat, they eat their eggs.
But if they're not willing to get out of them, if they're not going to see how food and their body is, they eat them, they're also what they do.
I see young people who work in this thing, but they're in this thing -- I see the kids who are in the same place, they're just in the same way, they're not going to be there, and they're not going to do it.
So I see the way that we can train children to help their communities to live a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could use the next Washington Washington Washington P.D.
But if we change the evolution of the planet, we're not going to do that.
So this is one of my tools. That's what I want to do.
I want to build a whole space of the spaces where people can actually share the same plant.
I want to take a ship of fruit mold and put them into a healthy restaurant.
So, you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free, because it's not sustainable.
The scientific innovation is that you have to be in order to be.
I'm talking about people who are going to go out of the streets and the streets, and they're the joy that you're going to learn to help and the privilege of food, if you're going to build food and local farmers.
So what I'm going to do is to make this cool thing.
I want you to be all of the environmental, the gang, the board, the boarders.
We need to go through the picture of the rock.
If you're not a game, you're not a shower.
You're going to be in a bunk, right?
And let's take the weapon of your choice.
If you want to make me, you're not going to say if you're in a game, you want to go and go and go to a meeting, you're talking about it.
If you want me to go up with your kitchen, in my backyard, we can use it to plant it.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite favorite favorite words in the conference is "The Life."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "The Soody Life" means "wood" as well-being."
In the 19th century, a magazine of a new definition: "Mono, somebody who is a public, someone who is a bank of the bank, or the NSA, or the NSA, or the law of the law, and its success, the power of the power.
I have no idea what the "wood" is.
And I think, you know, I think.
But it's very important to know that words in the state of politics, and all politicians know that they need to control language.
In 1974, a year of the British British British, the same paper, no idea of the word "wood" was the same word "wood".
And that was actually happening to the man's husband's husband with the extraordinary name of the great name, the minister of the year.
and she put it in the museum of London, and he was a man, but he was too hard, he was enough, he had enough, and he had a lot of support to the London, and he decided to bring him in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first term for "The" as well as a lot of people believe.
Tare the English word for the English word for the same.
But that's not true. It's going to go back to the NSA of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want you to take a look at the U.S.S. in the United States, as they're now the war.
You looked at the question of how you're in Washington, the state should be called.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leaders of the nation?
It was a long-term event in Congress.
And there were all kinds of things that were supposed to be useful.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Washington Washington, and others, and others, the Amazon, and others, and others, the power of the world, the people of America,
Not so much.
Some people wanted to call him the king.
They thought that's a perfect.
They were not a common altruistic, they wanted to give the king to a certain time.
It could have been done.
But everyone was madly uncomfortable because this three weeks later,
I read the days of a speech, which is always the same term: "I've been doing the same term."
The reason for the time was to be a long and the long-term, that was the city of the board.
The non-daughter department didn't want to be a work that was going to be.
The king, and it may be even more ideas to his ideas.
They wanted to give him the most powerful, un-known, the most popular, the ones that they could imagine.
This is "The Recess."
President. The title didn't have invented the title. It was, but it was just a person who was in front of a meeting.
This is how a kind of a b<unk>aeda.
He didn't have more size than the "w" or "w"".
Sometimes there were little-scale, local government and government companies, but it was really a very un-known title.
And so the NSA was so upset.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him the president.
This guy has to be sent to the fight and the foreign agencies.
Who is going to take it seriously if he's a great "The president of America have ever been here?"
And then three weeks ago, the NSA had not been.
And then you're not saying that the "The "The"" is "The""""" to use it, but they wanted to understand them, not to be aware of the values and the political, or the world, whether it's the world is the world, or the world, or the world, and the world, and the world, the world, the world, the world, the world, the world, the world, the world, the world, the
You can learn three interesting things.
One of the first is, and I think, I'm going to find out, I can't find if the U.S. Snowden has ever been the president.
Obama Obama Obama, the title of the title, he's just ready to get the case that the NSA is used.
Second, you can learn that if a government is a government, it's a bit more -- you can go back to 15 years later.
And thirdly, and that's really important, is the most important point: "The World Bank" is not just so much more than America, and it's not so scary.
And that's what's done with more than 5,000-dollar, and the biggest world has a huge and the largest economy of the world and the drone and the whole stuff.
and the story has been called the size of the size.
And so the NSA has been in the end.
They have a respect. They have a role.
And the other worry of the b.S., the power of self-esteem, it was now.
You know how many nations have a president?
14.
Because they want to sound like this guy who goes out of the high-tech, and so on.
So the end of the world is the NSA and the individual department, because nobody was feeling, if you're told, you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take you and I'm going to leave you.
So politicians are trying to use words to create reality and the reality, but actually the reality of the reality, the reality is to change more than the idea of the reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a board in a board, and I went to the S.S. to the S.C., a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, from Washington, from Washington, from Washington.
I was looking at my black-grandm-old elephant, a pair of pel-fine-fine-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-D-s-D-D-D-s-s-D
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And for a long time, I was born with war, but at least, I was talking about T-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A- and I's and the Asian-Americans and the world, and I had to think about the way that I had to do.
But that's the geography of self.
So I'm here now, I'm here, a very una-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-Americans, and a political artist, who worked in the last year.
So, so there are a lot of things in Afghanistan, and so you could do the art, but I don't want to make a sense of rain, I want to make the creative relationships and the character and the character and the way that we do, and we can understand the world, to create a way that we can do.
I want to spend a day in life of a national government, which is the government of the political government, like "wood" and the "wood" and the political political political and political political corruption.
And what can be the national government, as a year, as a leader, and a choice to help a campaign, "I'm going to do it." I'm going to be rich."
And I try to use this campaign to let these Miiii, to get it back to the National National National Bank.
I want to go to the corruption of corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "T," where you're in the way you're going to get a driver's head-to-to-to-s-s-s-to-half-half-s-half-and-half-s-s-s-s-s-half-s-s-s-s-s-dollar cars, and they're going to help them to get them
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has been created.
The war and the most compelling events that came with us, a new environment, and the only way you can just use it is to be a local, a local, a terrorist, and the drug, and the drug, and the drug, and I'm using a very high-quality, a non-quality, a non-quality, a non-tech, a non-furity, a non-furity, or a non-ex-furity, or-freat
And I'd like to see how simple a simple piece of mine from the past of the H.A. and a work, to create a dialogue that is today, to create a dialogue that is today, that is today, in fact, in fact, the world, in fact, the world, to help people have a great man, to help them, to be able to be able to have a man and to be able to be a man.
But for all of these things, you can go to jail, they can be surprised, and they might be unaware.
I do it because I need to do it because the visualization of self.
That's my 50. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Robert Snowden, and I've been working with a while I'm a model.
I was in the last 10 years ago.
I feel that there is a completely unconpable space in the room, because I didn't want to wear this gun.
Fortunately, I've got to focus on the power.
This is the first time that someone in TED, you can imagine it to be happy, so I think I think I think.
If a few women were really hard, I'd say, you've got to say, "I'm going to talk about it, I'm going to read Twitter.
I also also find that I'm very lucky, because I can change it in a very short 10 seconds of what you think about.
It doesn't have any chance.
These are very aggressive, it's good to do it, I didn't want to get it.
The most difficult part is to keep my head on my head, because you're going to do all of you, so you're not doing it for me.
All right.
Why did I do that?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not just like this picture.
Now, a visual image is powerful, but a visual image is also a visual.
I just have a moment in my four seconds.
And this picture -- I had to be in reality, a friend.
I felt very difficult, and the photographer told me, I would have to give my back to the back of the oil and my hand on this hair.
But instead of the medical and the wrong thing that I've been doing for two days to work, there are only a few very few basic potential, and even our understanding, and even our understanding, and even our understanding, and it's a lot of our lives.
Sess is too honest for me, I'm glad to be honest.
And I'm on this stage, because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage, because I'm a beautiful lady, and I'm in my business, we call a little girl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people always always do, but I think it's a kind of real way.
The first question is, "How do you do a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh, I've discovered it's not going to be anything.
The real thing I was a model of a model, is a demand in the genetic and a great challenge, and you might ask yourself what this is the legacy of this.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only been healthy and very young, and they're also a very creative, but they're also designed by the process, but also as big, and the most of them, and the most beautiful,
This is a legacy for me, and it's a legacy that was for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are in this point, and maybe some of the things, some of the "Mol, Pol, R.D.<unk>amp.D.<unk>s.<unk>s.<unk>amp.D.
And first of all, I'm going to show you the model of the model. It's incredibly amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2009, a very successful student in the University of the online program, all of the time, every single one of them was, and that the four percent were actually not only four percent.
The next question that always always always always asks me is, "Can I be a model?"
And finally, I said, "I don't know what it is not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I'm going to do is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can be the president of the United States or the ultimate world, or a monopoly, which would be a perfect-quality-to-Fi, because you would be the first one.
And when they're going to say this great, no, no, no, no, I want to say, "I'm going to call my boss."
Because I have no responsibility for you, and you could be the bossian American American American American doctor or the business company, or the next one of the next.
And so, you say, you're going to say, you're going to be a model, as you're going to say, you're going to get the email in the quad.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
So I want to tell you about 10 years of the model of the model, because it's different than the heart attack can now be just a result.
There's a paper, and the light is exactly exactly what a little bit like, and the driver says, "We want to play a photo, and then, again, you're going to take a picture, and then, you're going to go back and back and back and back, you're going to your arm, and you're going to see, you're going to see, you're going to see, you're going to see, you
It looks like this. It looks like this.
I think that's much more strange than the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
If you go to school and you have a life and a lot of jobs, you can't say a lot more, and if you say, you're going to be the president of America, but you want to be a kid in life, but you're going to be a little more old, you're going to be a little more old, you're going to get a little more old.
The next question is, I often asked to say, "Who are you all the photos?"
And yes, all of the photos are being made, but this is just a small part of what happened.
This is the first picture that I did, and that was the first time I had a C-D-D. I had no time.
I know that's now pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw just a few months before I was with my grandmother.
This is the day I'm in the front of this room.
My friend had to be in order to get me.
This is me in a rock of a rock, a couple of days ago, a TV guy in the French elephant.
This is me with the football team and the magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not me.
They're micro-re-re-re-re-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s
Okay, so next, people always say, "You're going to pay things?"
Yeah, I have a lot of p-and-Fi, I can't afford to be there, but I'm going to make things that I'm going to do, I'm going to talk about the real world, and I'm talking about it.
I was in Cambridge, and one day, I was in a store, and I had to forget my money, and you had to get me for me.
When I was a teenager, I was a terrible, a terrible driver, and she was looking at a red ball, and of course we were going to get a red, and we had to go and we could go back and we could have a "Awah, and we could have to go back.
I've done this cost of things like my view and not because there are people who are, because people like their relationship and not because they're a high price.
I live in New York, and the number of boys that were already arrested, and they were nine percent of the world, and most women and young men.
It's in New York City, a lot of young young men and black-American, who don't you say, "Did I have the question?"
I said, "How often do I get to jail?"
And in my research, I found that 80 percent of the week of the year, they don't like their body, and they're going to say that number up to 90 percent.
The last question is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they expect this answer: "If you're a little and a little-and-e-e-e-e-e-e- hair, you feel very, very, very happy."
And we're going to give a answer that might be the idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel, and it's great, creative, creative people, creative people."
It's true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never heard before, what I never said, "I feel."
And I feel safe because I have to think about what I think is going to think about my view every day.
And if you ask, "Do I feel better if I had a little legs and little hair and little hair?"
And then you're going to make a couple of sensors, because they're the most beautiful legs and the most cool blue and the most cool ones, and they're the ones that are probably the ones that are most likely to see their lives on the planet.
And so when I was ready to work, it was really hard to get a very difficult, because I felt very hard, and I was trying to say, "I've got a lot of the benefits, and I've got to say, "I'm going to get a piece of the cards, and I'm going to feel like, "I'm doing it."
It was really difficult to use a legacy of gender and gender, if I was one of the biggest ones that I was from.
But I'm happy, and I'm glad to be here, and I think it's great, I've done it before I was 10 or 30 years ago, and I would say, because I would not tell you what my first job is, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to do that, I'd like to do that.
And if you talk about this talk, hopefully, we hope that we all have the power of the sound of our mind and the evidence of the sound.
Thank you.
I didn't forget the words of my grandmother who had to come from life: "Mol, the Foli, the Foli, the Foli, the Foli.
I'm never going to be as a kind of a kind of revolution.
It's almost three years since the world's revolution, it's been inspired by the mass of the mass and the most popular species in the world.
I was trying to put many other other people in the outside, and in the outside of the day, to a day, to the war, and to the revolution, to the terrorist authorities.
And there was a big revolution.
A boy, women and men were in the first group, who were asked to the end of the court, and the freedom of freedom and social justice.
They were trained by the end of the political authorities to have a political terrorist,
They have a strong sense of humor, from the Middle East, to the end of the West, to the south.
And finally, after six months of war and war, almost almost almost about 50 dead, we brought our country to fight and to the end.
But the S.S. has a great peace, a legacy of corruption, corruption, and the way to do it.
Over four years, the Rolas's Law and the infrastructure, as the culture and the social structure of the social society.
The destruction and the challenges that I did, as many women, have a society, and we decided to build a strategy with a re-furity and civil democracy.
U.S. 200 organizations were used to be in the case of the case of S<unk>amp.C.<unk>amp.C. in S<unk>u, almost in 14 million.
After about 15 years of the head, I went back to Tol, and with a very complex, and I started to work with the potential of human development, human development, and international development.
And with a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace community, a movement of women, women, women, women, who are part of their own life, they're the goal for the public, and they're in the way to fight with the political and the political and the political and the political world.
In the case of the medical, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that has a completely stronger environment, and it's a very powerful environment that is the kind of political justice, the political justice of politics.
I was a campaign of peace, and I decided to give women a choice to get a law, a law, a law, no one of the people who are trying to answer the right side and the way to do it, and to try to make a difference between men and the political and political rights and the same way to do it.
and the end of the campaign was taken, and successful.
Women won't sell 9<unk>1 percent of the nation in the first year, in the first cases, for 15 years.
But also, the war was safe, but the war of the revolution and the revolution was "w," because every day we're going to talk about new news.
And we were looking at the rest of the M.S. to the R.S. and the most popular and popularists.
And one day, we got the message on the American American American minister and the attack to the message.
And then after a other morning, the suicide bombers were sent to the army.
And everyone is in the end of the law of the military and their efforts, they're focused on the rights of human rights and their rights and their laws.
Our society, a revolution of a revolution, a common, unconventable, and the principles of the principles and the "w" social, social, social rights, social rights.
Real, fear, and the way that was to be the symbol of the "s"-s"-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-"-s.
I'm not today to share with you about the success of our history, and the elections.
I'm still talking about this today, as a nation, we have a nation of the wrong choice and the choices.
We've got our problem.
Because the elections were not peace or peace, in S<unk>s, in the S.S.
Is the need of the world and the relationship between male and female rights and international peace and international leaders?
No, she didn't.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to be more and more unconventious, political politics, and the end of men and men and women?
And the women were not the only thing, but the female values, the female values, the one and the one.
Our society needs a national dialogue and the standard, as the elections, they had to have the end of the mountain and the polarization.
Our society needs to have the emotional signal of the female, more than the standard, the individual person's head-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-f-f-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-
We need to stop the name of fear and make a day to get the rest of the day.
We're going to start with the name of compassion and the rest of the word.
We need to create a female relationship that is not only about the values, but also to say, "Ton, instead of doing a problem, instead of a competition.
These are the political leaders that have to be a war of war, to fight peace.
Because peace has a case of a pist and in this case, it's about the culial and the gus of the gus and the intercination.
That's the real thing.
And we need to do that, before we do it, we're doing it.
After the word of the Arabic "s" <unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>""<unk>"<unk>"<unk>""<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>""<unk>"""<unk>"""""<unk>""<unk>"<unk>"<unk>n, God."
The word "w""" is also known in all of the world, the same "The""" as "The "The""" and the "The"-to-s" and the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the people, all the people, all the people, all the people, all the people, all the people, all the people, all the people, all the people, all of the people, all of the
And just like the mother's brain, which is growing in it, it's completely connected to the same belief of the human mind.
So we said, "My God's all the things."
So we said, "My father was in front of my work."
So let's all of us get the gus.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought that the best country was, and I grew up with the song "Jeopardy."
And I was very proud.
In the school, we're talking about the story of Michael L.S., but we didn't know much about the world, but it's a lot of people in the world, the South Africa and our religion are our creatures.
Even though I asked myself how the world was, I thought, I would spend all my life in North America, to go back to a moment.
I saw seven years ago, I saw a public public, but I thought, I thought, in North America, it was normal.
My family was not poor, and I had to have to suffer.
In the year, my mother took a letter from the sister, with my sister, a colleague of mine.
And then, he said, "If you're here, our family are not more than this world, because we've been doing two weeks.
We're in the ground, and our body is so so powerful that we're going to die."
I was so shocked.
I heard that people in my country were in the country.
And I was at the end of the bus, and I looked at something that I couldn't even get through my memory.
A pug woman was on the ground, and a bungey kid in her arm, and she was in his arm, she was in his arm,
But nobody did not have them because they were so busy, and their families are in their family.
In the 1980s, there was a huge drought in North Korea.
At the end of the world, a million refugees in the Congo, and many of them were just a lot of times, because they were eating the grass and the grass and the trees.
So, the power of the ground has been more likely to go back to night, but it was all the light of China from the other side of the U.S.
I always wondered why they had lights and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North America and their neighbors in night.
This is the river of the river, the part of the south and China is to be the state of China and China.
As you can see the river can be very, very, very, and it can be the river of North Carolina.
Many people die.
Sometimes I saw the body's body.
I can't say a lot about it, I'm going to go to North America, but I can say that I was born in the long-term death of China.
I just thought I was a short time of my family,
I'd have to think that it's about 14 years to work.
China was very difficult than young girls, not to live with family.
I had no idea of how life would be, as the North Bronx, but I was very, very, very, very, very, but it's not very difficult, but it's very expensive, but it's very expensive, because of the European Union, as the Asian Union, in China, in China, in China.
I lived in fear that my real identity could be able to fly, and you would get a terrible identity in North America.
And one day, my biggest place was, as I was born in the police, and the police police were sent to the police department.
Somebody was forced to me, North Carolina, so they did my Chinese, and they asked me to ask me about a number of questions.
I had this fear, I thought I would be going to be dead.
And any more unconventable, I could be able to be fired and actually be caught.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was trying to control my emotions and ask questions.
After the time, they were done, a leader said, "This is a sign. It was a sign.
She's not South Bronx."
And they were going to go. It was a miracle.
Some North America, he's in China, in China, and many of the people are already released by the police, and they're already looking at the police.
These girls had great luck.
Even though they were arrested, they were finally re-called international security.
This Southians were not so lucky.
Every year, North Korea in China, and they were looking at North Korea, where they're actually trained, or they're being used in public public, or they're being used.
Even though I was lucky, it's about many North Bronx reefs.
It's a very powerful, that North Korea are forced to fight their identity and to fight their lives.
and after the end of the language, they found a new language, and they can actually get their world in a moment.
So, 10 years ago, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started to start a new life.
I was in South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I would have.
English in South Korea, so important, I wanted to learn my third language.
And I've also found the big difference between North and South Asia.
We're all the same, but we're in a very different basis, because of the past of the past.
I was through a identity crisis.
Am I South South Carolina or South Bronx?
Where are I going to come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could be the home.
Even though the pressure of the beautiful life of the South Bronx, I had a plan.
I was trying to take the photo of the university.
I just like my new life was more un-time, I've got a call.
The North Bronx Bank started the money that I was sent to my family, and as a journalist, my family was forced to a place to a place in the country.
They had to be so fast as possible, so I started to open their river.
North Korea has to go back to the way to the freedom of freedom.
It's almost impossible to go from the border between Northeast and South Europe, and I took a flight to China and I took it to the way to the southwest.
Because my family didn't talk about Chinese, I had to give them more than 2,000 miles from China and then then then then then then then then then in South Asia.
The bus was a week, and we were almost almost dead.
One day, as the bus was in the prison, a Chinese police police police department was in the field.
He took the results of all of us, and started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand why I thought they would be.
When the Chinese leader was in the state of my family, I decided to say that she was a pist, and I was to be their own, and I was to be their own.
He looked at me, but luckily, he believed me.
We've done it to the bottom, but I had to spend all of my money to get the valleys of the river to the best.
But after we had the border, my family was in a way, because of the ground,
After the time, I was paid money and the money, my family had paid to a month of a month, but after that, my family was in the state of the capital,
This was one of the biggest experiences of my life.
I had all of my family to fight for freedom, and we were so close to my family, but my family was actually just just a very short story of the name.
I went to the Arab and the police department, trying to work, and I didn't have enough money to pay money to money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then I asked the voice of a man, "What are you going to come?"
I was really surprised to be a stranger.
In the same English English, and with a dictionary, I found myself in the situation, or not to go to a bank, and the money for my family and two other women, and two of them would get to jail.
I thank him about the heart of your heart, and I asked, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't want you." He said he said.
"I'm going to live the North Bronx."
I realized that this was a kind of cosmic moment in my life.
And before the last one of the people who had been a new hope to create the South Bronx, and he showed me that the friend of the boss and the support of the community, and the international community needs to need to need the international Union.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I started to move back to Southeast, but the freedom is just a step.
Many North America are being surrounded by their families, and as they start to build a new country, they're not doing it, or not with money.
The international community can help help help education, the English, the education, the education, many more and more.
We can also change the bridge between people in North America and the world, because a lot of us are in the family with their families, and we're going to send them information to the water, and they're trying to change the water, to the North Pole.
I had a happiness, so much of my life, and I've been able to get a great career in my life, I want to be successful in the Northwest, to help with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot of successful villages in the world, but also at TED,
Thank you very much.
I'm just going to give you a hand.
Don't tell you that I'm normal.
So I want to show you my brothers.
So, the name is two and very good, very well.
He can't talk about it, but he's learning a way that some of the best songs could not be.
What's love.
He's doing it, and he's going to put it in the back.
It's not. He's not in the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and you just say, "There's no one.
When he was writing songs of childhood, it's not a moment to see me, I remember a little bit about what we know about the mind and how the truth would be and the great thing.
Adam II is big. He's very good.
He has a absolutely unconstable memory.
but he also has a double-creat.
He can't remember if he was calling my chocolate, but he was surprised by the interview of a song, I had the last email on the morning, the first time I was to talk about four times when the first one of the first-time-to-old, and I had to take my head-to-old, and I had to take my head-to-old, and I had to get my head-to-old.
Don't listen to it?
But many people are not right.
And in fact, it's because your mind is about the social version of the brain, they often seem to be wrong and wrong.
But what my heart was to help and my soul was that, although it was the case, it was, even though they were not, they were, they were just a question: they were incredibly unusual and unusual.
Now, for those of you who don't really feel the term "cood" is complex, it's a complex brain of the brain, the social behavior, and sometimes the skills are learning.
It's a very different way of each individual, and it's a different way to be from the way.
And the world will be seen every 10 minutes of a new language, and even though, it's one of the most powerful development development systems in the world, there's no doubtable or not even the evidence.
And I can't remember the first time when I was a neuroscientist, but I can't remember it every day.
I was three years old, as my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He's very much.
He didn't want to play the same thing that babies were doing, and it was actually not really interested in me.
And in fact, a living room and had a little bit of their own rules, and he found that he found a lot of fun things like cars, like cars in a room, and he was doing everything that would eat and do anything.
And as he was older, he was different and the differences were completely different.
But the father's father and the shak and the end of neuroscopic surgery was something that was really different and unhealthy, a boy who saw a boy who had never seen the world.
It's a very unusual.
Now, I can't believe that there were some moments in my family, I wish I was the ones that I would like to do.
But I'm going to go back to the idea that I taught you about the things that I've taught, and love, love, love, love, love, and I understand that's the things that I should not be responsible.
So what is that the beauty of the beauty of the differences, and the fact that we are different, is not that we are wrong.
It's just the way that there are a different way of the right.
And if I just want to say a thing to say, and to Sam, you might be normal.
You can be incredibly powerful.
Because, it's not, the differences that we have, we have a gift, a gift, a gift, all of us, and the inspiration is the ultimate definition of the potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change, in the moment, is to try and try to do something else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So R<unk>L.D. Snowden has a conversation with curiosity, and with this photo, with a project of a mouse, and with a signal, a second-term event.
Now, now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times faster, and we're not going to see a million or a billion neurons, but a billion pictures per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of design that is the ex-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D
And so we can build cameras that are looking at the outside of our view, or without a picture of a brain, and we can see what we do with my camera.
So now, I'm going to take a laser, and it's in a second-dimensional scale, and it's a second-term version of the quad, and it's a micro-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-half-by-half-dimensional, and it's a piece of paper, and it's not very much more than a new project, and it's a new scale, and it's going
So, if you take this project, this is this, this is, this, and you can put it in this bottle, like this, like, what are these sensors in the bottle?
So what's the light in time?
So this event -- this event --
So, you think that's a whole event that's going to do more than a 3D, so it takes the light to the light, but I've got to try to take this video to see the 10 billion seconds of the light, so you can see the light.
No, gold-Cola, that research has not been done.
So, in this movie, it's a lot of time, so let me show you what happens.
The pulse, the project, the project is moving into the bottle of a laser, and then starts to move, and then the end of the box is moving.
And part of the light is on the table, and you see the flow of the box and you see the waves.
Many of the slime mold is now going to get the pressure of the bottle and it will be in different directions.
As you can see, there's a air air that's in the bottle that's in the bottle.
In fact, the waves are on the table, and because of the side of the screen, you can see that the visual patterns of the photo are a couple of pictures.
So if you're going to take a really big project, and you can take it back and take the same video back to 10 billion seconds later, you know, how long you're going to see this movie?
One week, a week, no. No, a year.
It's a very nice movie -- a very, very, very, very, very, very, very normal project, movement.
And what is it like to see a bit of a life-time-time-time-time-day experience?
You can see the waves of the table, the T.R., the ceiling and the wall on the screen.
It's like when you're in a river, you're going to get a rock.
I was thinking about how nature was a picture of the way that a photo of a couple of seconds, but of course, we see a picture of our eyes.
But if you look at this, you can see that when the light is going to be, if the light goes from the light, you're not going to be completely dark.
Why? Because the hell is, because the hell is, and the light is in your light, and it's going to take a look at a hundred seconds.
So in the future, if this is a camera in your pocket, it could be possible, it could be in a supermarket, and you can see if you can't even touch it, if you're not there.
So what did my team in MIT have this camera?
So as a journalist, if you know, if you're doing a photo of a long-term, you're doing a little light, but we're going to take a billion times faster than the long time, so you're going to get a little bit of the air.
So we're doing this project, we're going to send this project, and we're using this, and then we're going to take it up, and then we're going to start with very simple data and then with these data and then we're using these data, and we're going to show you the video.
And we can take all of these cool data and do it with very interesting things.
So, Rick, can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how would it be a new future for a new new new, new-dimensional, can you see?
The idea is that we're going to put a light on the door.
It's going to go into space, and then, a part of the room will come back back to the door, and then we could take this light back to the camera and we could take that more of the light-like light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, we see our camera camera camera.
On the wall, a wall is a wall, and we're going to turn the light back to the door.
After our paper paper, the "The World War II" was published, it was called the C.D.D. and they've created this animation.
We're going to take the light project of the project, and they're going to put it into the wall and then these little pieces of these satellites, and they're going to be able to get all of the light and then we'll get the light and then, and then we'll get it back to the light, and then it's going to be a little bit of the same, and then it's going to be going to be going to be a
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our robot camera has a very specific abilities.
She has a very good time to look at the world and they can look at the speed.
And so we know that, of course, we know, the way to the door, but also the objects that we don't know what's going on.
So, in order to make a laser, we can take a switch, like this -- how do you see it in the screen, but if we can actually see many of these images, and then we're going to try to try and try and try and try to see the pattern of the light, and we can see the pattern of the light.
Can we see it in 3D?
So here's our paradigm.
We've got a lot of things to do before we can do the lab, we could build cars and see the things that can't see, and we can see the curve, or to the surface, or to the way we can see the light, we can actually see the windows, and we can actually see the windows, and we can actually start to see the same way that we can actually see the body and the body, and we can see the way that we can see the
But because of the blood and the brain is a very useful idea, which is why it really is a call called a call for scientists, now, for example, is now a new paradigm, a new version of the future.
So, like, for example, in the C-D.D., a scientist, a science, a science, a science, a digital sculpture, and I realized that all of these data are going to do this, we can just use all of these data, and we can just use the data, and we can just take a picture of the data and a piece of time, and we can do this, and we can do this, and we can do this kind of light-
But it's actually a bit of fun.
And if you look at the waves of the flies, you see that the waves are coming from us.
The waves should be moving.
What happens?
And it turns out that we're almost in light, amazing effects, and Einstein, and Einstein would have seen this picture.
The way that happens in the world is that what happens in the camera, in a way, by looking at the relationship between the relationship and the space, we can do this.
So, not, if you can go through the photography or the way that is to create a new paradigm of medicine or engineering, or the invention of technology, we've been able to challenge all of our data and the data and the data and the data, and we're trying to start to start to start to try to do the data, and we're trying to try to start to try to do this in the data, and we're going to try to try to try
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities that our lives can improve our lives.
We don't usually make any neighbors on the street, so many of the sexual events are not going to be used, but we use the same public public space.
In the last few years, I tried to share more and more things like the things that are like a little bit of the kets and the fruit flies.
And the projects were made by asking questions, how much money to my neighbors?
How do we use more things, without others?
How do we do our memories to share the buildings and the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the home, so our communities and our dreams?
I live in New York, and I love New York.
My soul is going to be surrounded by the huge, the hundreds of years, the shaky and the shadows and the shadows, I'm going to give a city, I'm going to have a city in the music.
I think every time someone never never ever ever has, in New York,
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but they are also the city of the city, and they're also the most of the most of the time in America.
I live in the room, and I thought, how do I do it? And I thought I was going to think about this life.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved.
His name was M<unk> and her mother was like a mother, and she was suddenly dead.
I've been thinking about death, and I felt a great joy for my life, and it took me to the things that I've been interested in life.
But it's hard to keep that perspective every day.
It's easy to lose in the daily life, and forget what is really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I started to go back to a giant house, and I wrote a huge, and I wrote a little bit of the world: "I want to get a life, I want to imagine someone who wants to do this, and I can imagine that this story, and think about this, a life, and a life, and a life of life.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do in the experiment, but it was a window that was completely completely completely completely completely open, and they were still growing.
I'm going to share with you some of the things that were written by the wall.
"I'm going to do that, I want to be in order to be a bit of the stuff."
"I'm going to get a very high-term basis from the National Rights."
"I'm going to teach you about millions of people."
"I'm going to build a tree."
"I'm going to live in the world."
"I'm going to make sure I'll just be in the poor."
"I'm going to be a person I want to be in the art of the book."
"I'm going to be a self-interest."
This was a place that was designed to be a very difficult place, and the dreams of the world, and the dreams were to laugh me and to the coldest time.
It's about knowing that you are not alone.
It's about our neighbors to understand and create a new way.
It's about the place to think and think about what we are, what is the most important thing we are, and how we are growing.
I did this last year, and hundreds of people who were willing to build a wall with their community, and so I built my colleagues and I built a building system, and now I've been building a building and in the world in South Africa, and all the other places, and other villages, and other villages, all the world, and other places, and other trees,
We've shown how much power is, if we have the opportunity to share our voices and to share other people.
Two things we have, time, are the relationships and the relationships.
In a world where you're more likely to look at things that are more than the right time, and think about the right time, and it's very close to life.
We're often talking about death, or just to think about death, but I've found that the death of death is one of the things that we are most of us.
And the idea of death is to make us feel of life.
Our common world is the best species, as individuals and the community, and more importantly, more ideas, and we can share our stories and share the world, to help us do better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm interested in math, a very complex problem, to everyone who is working with math, we're a business company.
No one knows what we do.
So I'm going to explain what I do.
Take is a human activity.
We're actually stunged by the blind-up-up-up-up-p-p-p-p-p-p-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s
So the ball is a huge amount of information and abilities, and perhaps the possibility of a specific, a combination of the genetic neurons that could have a genetic model.
Sadly, the stress disorders of depression are so slow, and that makes them the ability to be in my grandmother's, including the way that he was to be a keyboard to be a keyboard.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in the treatment.
But yet, there are two million people that have to suffer in this disease, and they have to have to have to be the most powerful, like the risk of the risk, like, and other people, and more of that, we need to think about the potential of the disease.
We need to measure the progress of the potential, and finally, the only way to know whether it's a potential, if we have a potential to answer that question.
So, in trouble, it's a lot of control and other behaviors, so you can't do a simple memory, so you can't do a simple amount of blood-speed sensors. That's what we're doing in this case.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, in fact, in fact, the clinical studies, it never never never has.
What if the patients could do this test for home?
So that would be a re-time school in the hospital, which would be if the patients could do that?
It wouldn't have to do it.
It's about 300 percent of the neurological species.
So I want to conclude with you a non-term approach that we're trying to do, because we all are in a certain way, in a certain way, like my name, I'm talking about the way that I's my name.
Here's a video of the feedback.
This is happening in the state of the situation when someone's disease is constructed, we can look at the same-quality, because we have to look at all of these organs, and we're going to use all of these organs, and we've got to use the DNA, and we've all of the genes.
And as the ball is required to make a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn it.
And so we can actually turn the position to the position of the individual, and like the anticels are actually the ability to prevent the blood vessels of the activity.
On the top, you can see an example of the stress, for example, you can see the aerodynamic processes.
We're still seeing the same symptoms.
It's a legal, unconcession, unconvention.
The language is going to be even more and more and more vulnerable, and that's a example of the way that we can do.
Now, this is a lot of information that can be used, sometimes with digital algorithms, and then with micro-dimensional algorithms, with a new model, and we can now see that's a very advanced tool, and now we can now see someone who's now in terms of health and the health, and the brain is only in the way.
How do these tests do we measure clinical trials? Well, they're not both non-re-re-re-re-proc-c-proc-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D
It's just a lot of infrastructure. It's already there.
You don't have to build new hospitals.
And they're exactly exactly the same thing. They're not experts.
So you can actually be used by the same.
They're very fast, high-term seconds.
They're very cheap and we know what this means.
If you're a very cheap, you can use it in a very high scale.
So this amazing goals is now what we can do.
We can reduce the most difficult information for patients.
We don't have to use patients in the hospital.
We can increase the potential of more events in more events.
We can do high-scale mass-scale studies, and we've been able to get the first population of the population.
We now have the opportunity to look at the disease of disease before it was too late.
Today, we're doing the first step, we're going to start to start with the Parkinson's disease.
So we want to take a C-D.D.D.D., we want to take a very high number of voices in the world to get enough data to help that.
We have a standard number of data that are available to a billion people in this planet.
Everyone, with no drug, you can call it, you can take a few minutes, and I'm sure we've been doing it, we've been doing six percent of our goal in a day.
Thank you.
If you're going to say, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can say who are healthy and not?
What do you do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient is going to have to be a call of the call, whether that person is not in the disease or not.
Some of them might be used to be the end.
But we're doing a huge database in different ways, which is important. These are important. We're also trying to figure out what the actual code is for example.
So, for the time, you have to do it for the same level?
It's much better.
My students -- I need to do it because it's so fantastic, it's now -- it's now now that it's now that it's now that the cell phone is working on the system, and we're going to do it, and we're going to be at least 10 percent of the data.
I call this a potential.
So that's the people that can do -- people can do the phone and test the phone, and they could use the phone, and they could use their voice, so they can use the response to the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Good, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Dr.
Here I live in Kenya, in the South Bronx, in the middle of the South Park.
You see the blood of my father and the front of the house is the middle of the South Park.
The South Park is in the south, just as a result, and that means that the areas can't even go to the park.
The bubbles, the lions, they follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our seeds.
This is one of our trees that died at night, and she was dead, and she was dead. It was a great one.
My tribe, the individual, the animal, that we're looking at animals and the Amazon, and so we've come to the sky, and so we're saying, we're going to see so much of our animals.
I learned as a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our name is called the victims of our individual and our neighbors are also in the problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions in the South Bronx,
And I think there are in the South Park, and there are only a few lions.
In my village, a boy is a boy between six and six years later, and the family was responsible for his father, and it was like me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Men feared fire.
But then I realized that we shouldn't help us, but the lions would be better.
But I didn't have. I got it back.
I had a second idea. I tried to put it in a bird.
I wanted to think the lions were going to go back to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You're going to see the bird is going to go back, and then they're going to go back, and they're going to say, "Oh, this is not going to work, but that's still where it's still there.
And they're going to kill our soldiers.
I was a night of the air. I went to a hand and I was walking around the hand and not the lions.
Men fear light is moving.
I had a idea.
It was a little boy, and I worked all the time in my room, and once the new radio was coming up, and I had to learn much about electronics. But I had to learn a lot of paper.
I took a old battery, and a power device, and it shows you, or if you want to go up to the right, or you want to get it up.
And I took a light, and I took a light to the lights and the lights.
This is a small-and-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-t-t-t-Fi.
And then I built all together.
The solar engine is the battery that takes the battery to the power. I call it a thermostat.
And the power of the bakes.
You can see the pelps are coming from the outside, because of the birds.
And this is what the lions are going to come when they're going to come.
The lights are down and the lions believe that I was on the board. And I was the whole time in the bed.
Thank you.
I've been home in home, and we had no problems with lions.
And then we heard our neighbors.
One of them was the grandmother.
They had many animals in their animals, and they asked me if I could use the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I've been able to see the lights. They can see the lions in the background.
I've been in the neighborhood, I've been working on seven houses in the neighborhood and they're really good.
My idea is now in Kenya, also for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, like fruit and fruit flies, they can also use the lights to be used to be used by the elephants.
My invention was to a journalist in the world of a successful school, university, National School, and I'm really excited.
My new school work is helping and international aid and education.
I even had my friends home home, and we're going to put the lights there, where there are no lights, and I'm going to show you how to use them.
A year ago, I just met a boy from the black elephant, who was born by the milk, and I looked at paper, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a room."
And here I am here.
I was trying to play a plane on a plane, for my first TED Talk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane, and the pilot will be, that's my great dream.
I used to go through the past. But I was able to save the blood of my father and the lions, and we can go to the side of the men, with the birds, without the birds.
Adam S.<unk>ia: In my language, which means, "I thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear your story.
So you've got this training. Yeah.
You're doing the same-scale communication.
So what is the next list of the list?
So my invention, now, I work on a motor engine. A motor.
Yeah, I know, electrical signals have been done, but I want to have a own.
You've just tried it. Yeah, I did it, I tried to try to try and try it, because I got a ball.
So, the beginning is very hard. Richard. Richard.
We're going to take you back to your hand, my friend.
Thank you very much.
I've been old enough, a camera in the hand, my passion, but today I want to share with you my favorite show, and not one of them.
There was no kind of a kind of non-tech, no chance to just get a picture. It was not a picture.
And to be honest, most of them were already taken in the cave.
So I started thinking about a talk about a talk in New York City, and my wife was doing this picture, I was in my daughter's birthday, and we were at the top of five and five minutes of the corner.
So this is a year later, we went back to New York, and we decided to actually get the same picture.
Now, you can see where that's going on,
So, the third birthday of my daughter said, "Hey, why don't you go to New York City and do it do it, and they're doing a Nigerian friend to get the ritual to the ritual to get the ritual to be the way to get the ritual?
And then we started to ask to ask the tourists, a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like the essence of the mind, when you're a stranger, you're completely blindly enough.
No one has said, no one's happiness, and I'm not sure someone with the camera.
And we didn't know how much of our life would change.
This journey has been very vulnerable.
This is just a month ago, and I had to explain what happened next day, so it was like a five-year-old.
These images are much more than just a moment or a certain journey.
They are also one way in the morning, and for the time, to our time, and how we change our time, not only but to change the way year, but also to be in the way.
Because even though we do this image, we can change our perspective as long as they can go through, and then they can go through new miles, I can see them in their life, and how they see it, and they see it.
This is a very high time that we're doing something that we're going to expect and have every year.
In fact, while we were in a cave, we were all over, and we were all very close to a very, and they're looking at a red-shaped, and they're looking at a very small-time kid, as a kid, when they're learning, I've learned, as a kid,
And she told me about their feelings that they were like five-year-old, and they were in this place.
She said she was aware of her heart of the chest, when she was nine years old, when the car was the first time.
And now, she looks in New York City, because they're really interested in New York City.
And what was really clear: The most important thing we're creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of a very common role in the audience to be able to be able to take memories.
I don't know how it looks like, but I'm not very close to this video, I'm not very close to a family.
I'm always the picture of this.
I want to share with you today with you to come up with the picture and say, "Can you ask me a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
