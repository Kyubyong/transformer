When I was 11 years old, I was struck by the sound of the sound of the night.
My father heard on his little white radio show on the BBC.
He was very happy about what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was very angry by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but my father was obviously very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning I'm never going to forget.
A real school.
The Taliban were focused on the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was preparing for five years as a boy and my older sister who didn't have to be used to be a secret school.
And so we could go to school for both of them.
Every day, we took another way that nobody could guess where we went.
We have hidden books in a shopping store so it looks like we're going to go to the store.
We've been in a house where we've been living in 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of awkward, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were facing our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then, all the time, the class had to fall out for a week, because the Taliban had to hold the alarms.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are they worried?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and being important and daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan, and his daughter, my mother -- to school, and was thrown out of his father's father's father.
My mother was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to turn our house into school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first person in his family who ever received a education.
It was always clear that his children would be a education, but his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as much greater risk to send his children to school.
I know that in the years, I was so frustrated in the Taliban, and I was so frustrated about our life, the constant fear and the perspective of despair.
I had a good joke to give my father, and my father said, "Toyar, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be thrown out of the war from your house.
But one thing you're going to keep is what's in here. And even if we pay our blood to pay your lunch school, we need to be able to do that.
So you want to ask me to go back?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by the war for decades.
Less than six percent of my age, the great degree of marriage, and when my family had not been so strong to use my education, I would have a woman.
Instead, I'm standing here today as a proud activist in the American College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was beaten by his family because he was accused of his daughters to school, one of the first who was shocked by me.
He's not just going to work with my graduate school, but I was the first woman who's driving him through the car behind Kabul.
My family thinks of me.
I have great dreams, but my family has more rich dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for education for women.
And so I helped to start with MALA, and maybe the only public bank park for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school school is still less risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how students of my school would be very powerful and powerful for the potential to ever be able to see all the potential.
And to see how their parents and fathers are in their own, like my parents, despite their assaults and their opponents.
As Ahmedabad. That's not really a name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter was in the home of SOLA in her village, and she's the death of a bomb through the street to just a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone broke, and a voice would send him to school, if he was going to go back to school, she would try it again.
He said, "Tow me now, if you want to, I'm not going to put the future of my daughter's game because of your old-fashioned and awareness."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that is often being reported in the West, the fact that most of us have succeeded is a father who sees the value of his daughter and realize that it's also success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers are not going to play a very important role in our success.
They're often more likely to be aware of the fact that they're very compelling and compelling about the promise of their daughters's future, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men are unaware of the support.
The Taliban only went a hundred girls to school, because it was illegal.
Today, the school bank is happening on three million girls.
Afghanistan appears to look like America, so different.
The Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long, and the result of the U.S. population is changing everything.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and her parents who are willing to encourage them to be a very promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan for me is one country of hope and the unconportable possibilities, and remember the girl, the Long MALA.
I mean, as I have great dreams.
Thank you.
I do whatever I do, even as a living life -- was inspired by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1977, I see young -- but it's not -- -- I've worked in Sambia, Kenya, Portugal, Somalia and Somalia, and Somalia, working with the technical projects of African countries.
I worked for an Italian company, and every single project that we put on the legs was failed.
I was very desperate.
I mean, 21 years ago, we thought that we're good at Italy and good people who are successful in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which was inspired by the "Royh" in Zam Abam, was one of the things that we wanted to show in Italy to the people of Sambiqueia, like food.
We came to Italian seed in Southeast to this, which is what the Sami River is going to lead to the University of the local population of the local animal-based meat and the Caste.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we were paying them to work for the work, and sometimes they were also beginning to get into it.
And we were surprised that there was no such a way of a waste in the valley that agriculture was.
But instead of asking why they didn't make it, we said, "Thank God, that we're here!"
"Mearst in time to save the people of Sambique."
Of course, all of them are wonderfully wonderful in Africa.
We had these very aggressive tomatos. In Italy, they were as big as the size of Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how agriculture is."
When the tomato is closed and red, about 200 pelels from the river and everything.
We said to the Samb, "Oh God, the pier!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us?" "You never asked us."
I just thought that we were a brilliant stereotypy in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what French men did, and then I saw what the French was doing. And then I was pretty proud about the project in Portambia.
We've been putting the pestporms at least.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we don't have to have the most-year-old people.
You should read the book "The Chadque" Masa Moyoyo, it's a national economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We have a national African continent of a trillion trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was going to do.
Just think about her book.
You can read from a African, what we've been doing was we've been doing?
We are Western people, colonialists, missionists, and there are only two species of ways of how we deal with people. We're going to be a patriist.
Both words are from the Latin root root, which means "gather."
But they have two different meanings.
Religical: I'm going to have a different culture of another culture than they were my kids. I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm going to make a different culture than she was my boss.
That's why white people are called "lirry," the boss.
I was shocked when I read the book "Lally Beauty" in terms of the day, and he said, especially in the economic development of people, if not want help, then let me go back.
That should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This conference morning, who opened up the board, and said, "Can you imagine a city that doesn't have a biococopholic colonization?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I decided to be a system called a company that never gets done in the process, never gets a rewarded, but you will be motivated to be a drug-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-law, the local community, the local man who has a better person.
What you do is you keep your mouth.
You never have a community with ideas, you're going to connect with the local community.
We don't work on offices.
We're going to meet in cafeteria. We're going to meet in Kulale.
We don't have infrastructure.
We are going to close friend friends and find out what person wants to want.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone a idea.
If that person doesn't like to do what to do?
The passion for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion for your own body is the most important thing about humanity.
We help them find knowledge because nobody can be successful.
The person who has no idea, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case, why not to come into a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them in community? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There is a problem with community collections.
You're never going to be part of entrepreneurs, and they'll never say what they want to do with their money, what they see for the opportunities.
So the plan has this white spot.
The smartest people don't know about the community because they never seem to be in public peace.
We're working on one thing to do this, a social infrastructure has to be made, not.
It's going to be a new job of creating a new job.
This is the home of the company who's a medical school who's sitting in the house with you in your kitchenboard and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools that you're going to transform in a kind of passion to transform your life.
I've tried this in-on, West Street, trying to do this.
I'm a researcher at the time, trying to avoid the unhealthy, where we say other people should be done to escape.
And so I went through the streets for the first year, and in the first three days, my client, I helped him, he was in a garage, he was Maiii, and he helped me go to a restaurant in a restaurant, and then he said, "You know, the fishermen would help you?" And the farmer would help you?"
I helped these five fish, and this wonderful tuna not to sell in a factory in Oakland for 60 cents to be gay for the Japanese store, but they came to lunch for 15 dollars, and they said, "Hey, you're helping me." You're helping me."
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing a lot of hard, really hard.
I feel the mouth and listen to them."
So -- so the government says, "Look, let's take it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped over 40 companies in the organization.
There's a new generation of companies who are going to be distracting loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers of history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a professor before he started working with companies. Peter says, "Make is actually unfinished in reality with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So planning is the death of entrepreneurs's spirit.
So you build Christ's face without knowing what the smartest human Christy man wants to do with her money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get you to a person.
You have to give them a discion and privacy. You have to be great to help them, and they will be more nuptant.
In a community of 10,000 people, we'll get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people who have intelligence and passion?
What you've ever been wondering about the presentation today?
"Hear, passionate people. You've got that. They're just feeling well.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to be.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- we have the unhealthy fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The fuel engine is not sustainable.
The free-scale culture is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways to cure, and to transport and to overcome them.
The technologies don't exist for this.
Who will reinvent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Are you afraid?
The government? Are you sorry!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a great story in a pre-terrorist magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the city of New York City in 1850 to 180.
In 180, they came together and they were suspended, and they would be seen in the city of New York City, and the conclusion was that the city would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grew up in the speed, they needed six million horses to get the people to get it, and it would be impossible to be done by six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
In fact, 180, they see the dirty technology that lives in New York City.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there was 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology was the race. There was little factories in the back of the country.
Sivior, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered to be a gun.
They don't get to talk to you.
Next thing you have to offer is absolute, committed and passionate services.
and then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest company to be able to do three things: selling the product to be great, the market market market, has to be super-felled, and the financialization must be huge.
Do you guess what?
We never met a single person who's using something at the same time, selling money.
This is not a thing that is happening.
This person was never born.
We've been doing research and we've been looking at the 100 most popular companies of the world -- Carnegie Wardhouse, Ford, the new companies, Google, CNN.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have known to be, not only one person.
Now, we teach 16-year-old entrepreneurs in North Korea, and we start to give them the classroom to give the first two sides of Richard Briswellography, and the task is the woman's wife's wife, in the first two sides of Richard Briswell, which often often described "The Spistues" as the word "s" and "the word "the."
Never again, 32 times "cove."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who sits in the cafes, sit in cafes and Bars, and they sit with their buddy friends who are doing what someone here has done for this gentleman who says, "You know, that's what you need to be a community."
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to think about you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support the organization to help them find the means and help people, and we found that the wonder of the local people's intelligence of the local population, and that culture can be transformed by the culture of the community, just by the passion of the power of the people and their imagination.
Thank you.
I've seen five years ago how it should be, Alice's miracles in the world.
The Penn State asked me -- a leader of communication -- to put engineers into communication.
I was scared.
Be honest. So these students with their large brains and their large books and their large books, not to be trusted by words.
But when the conversation came, he was doing how Alice was going down to the fly to see the pig bomber and a door on a completely new world.
I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed about the idea that they wanted to be, and that others found that miracleland.
I think to open the door, it needs great communication.
We need to really need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy and health, and if we don't know about it, and they don't understand it, it's not going to be progress. I think it's not a policy in our responsibility as a scientist.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to be miracles in their miraclesland.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, go ahead.
I want to show you a few ways of how you can do it, that science and technology that you're busy with you is sexy and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer is, and what?
So let's tell you why your scientific field is so relevant for us.
It doesn't mean that your pids are being studied, but it also tells us that their pelels are studying the plastic structure in our bones, because it's important to detect oopia and treat.
And if you tell that what you do, then you're going to have preventable dictionaries.
There's a obstacle to understanding your thoughts.
Now, you might be sure that you could use your own breath and time, but why don't you just say, " Space" and time, what is a lot more helpful for us?
We don't want to make our thoughts understand, it's not the same as the level of the level of magnitude.
As Einstein said, "Make things as simple as possible as possible, but not easier."
You can tell something about your scientific area without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Some things are going to be interested in this: examples, stories and analogies. So this is how you can turn you into your booth.
And if you were to show your work, then let's get the dots away.
Have you ever asked why it's called the point?
What happens when someone gets to mind? Somebody's only going to take weeks and with these dots, and these dots are the first dots of your audience.
So a slide like this is not just boring, but it's also very boring to talk about the work-making part of our brain, and that's how we're focused on it.
This example of Gene Brown is a much more powerful one. It shows that the special structure of the dry system is so stable that it actually has the inspiration for the original design of the Eiffel.
Now the trick here is to use a single sentence that's going to lose the audience when it's going to lose the thread, and the images that are also going to respond to our senses, and then it creates a deeper understanding of what you think.
These are just a few ways that help us open the door and see the wonderland, the science and the technology.
And the engineers that I taught, who taught me to make a little bit of contact with the "Nar" I want to turn everything on a equation.
Look at your science and your writing "creat" is going through this, and then the way you look through the memorial, and the audience says, what's important is, and it's going to be the whole thing that you've been passionate about for your work, and that is that you've seen that the interactions are completely new.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was very interested in it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can actually film a crime in the human Syria.
You can go to a cell phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And if you take a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get it up in sound-up and be famous.
That's all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in the time.
You can see how hundreds of people went out to the street and see what was happening on the street.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we asked that all of these people who were coming through and they were asking to change, a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep up.
Keep it up. Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost every cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35830 lines full of information.
Pell data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, E.N. Senate has a direct line.
The law of the law is called the banks of the law.
The rule of this line is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service in Europe, has to store a range of information in Ben's Law.
Who calls who's going to send a email?
Who's going to send a text on the board?
And if you use a cell phone, where you are.
All of this information will be stored at least six months to the phone company for about six years or two years or a phone service.
And everywhere in Europe, people were up and said, "We don't want to be."
They said, we want to be not adequate at the military supply.
We want to be self-detignity in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies to store the Internet and the Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests who said, "We don't want to be."
And here you can see how tens of people went out of the streets of Berlin, and they said, "Fake fear."
And some people even said this could be the singing line of 10,
The drama was the head-in-in-in-vati in eastern easternland.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can all of this information be about us?
And every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company who was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked her, I asked all of you about the information that you've had on me.
And I asked her, and she said, "I didn't have a right answer, and I had a better answer. It's like, "Sowa."
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, it's the back of the stock.
So I decided to put a court trial against it because I wanted to have this information.
But the Great Telegraph said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And at the end of that, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to go back to the track of what they would send me information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court minister decided that the introduction of E.S. is the prime line of law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown brown, with a CD.
And on the CD, this was.
3580.30 lines of information.
First of all, I saw it, and he said, well, it's a huge date. My hand.
But then I realized, for a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I want to start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to do a report.
Because I want to show the people what was called the landfill.
So with time and open data, I did this.
This is an visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom in, you can go back and go back.
You can take every step that I do, go back and check.
And you can even see how I'm going to drive by Frankurt, and how many calls I'm going to go out.
And that's possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I call my wife and calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then a few friends call them a couple of friends, and they call them each other.
And after a while, you call you, and you call it, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, like the leader of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction map for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who you're talking to who to listen to who a email is possible, all of you have access to that information.
And this information is being saved for six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we wondered that all of these people in the streets of the street in the fall of the Cold War had cell phones in the air.
And the singingers knew who was at the demonstration, and when the poet knew who the leader was, then it would never happen.
The case of the Berlin wall would not have happened.
And then the case of the iceberg curtain.
Because government agencies today want to store so many information and companies like they can get away from us online and online.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But self-interest and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They have to fight for that every day.
So if you go home, you say that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not the old age.
If you go home, you say, you're just a representative, because companies and government have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company to get the information that you've lost about it.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight the self-interest in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Central.
This is South Central Park: the shirts, the rapid restaurants, the tapway.
So the city map is going to make the name of Central Central Africa, so that it changed it for something else in South Los Angeles, and it changed it as if it changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Poor police, rapid restaurants, the tapest.
Like 26,5 million Americans live in the food forest in Central Los Angeles, the home of Dr.K. HeForShe and the Drensy.
The comblar is that the Drive man is killing more people than the Drensyys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles to be able to live in unrelated diseases.
Now, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in the Osel Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really get it to see.
And I wondered how you would feel if you had no access to food, if you go out of the house, the negative effects of food that you have in your neighborhood.
I've been able to buy the skles and sell as transportation.
I see the conversation of drama bubbles like Starbucks.
And I realized that that's not going to stop it.
I realized the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem of food and food, the solution is.
And I didn't have a funny job on the age of about 18 minutes to get a apple that doesn't be under the pesticide.
So I planted a food fireland on my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park plant.
It's 45 feet tall.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to be engaged.
So I think, "Dool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it in the position."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came up and my group, the L.A. Green Beowers, and we started to plant my food and fruit flies, and then the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of professional group, together from the friends of all the different layers of the city, and it's completely prepared to do everything we're doing, free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else is concerned.
The city came to me, and he was basically a propulsion, and he said that I had to get my garden, and I realized that my garden was a draination of a conpicial.
And I thought, "Well, come up? Right?
A set of re-creating for food from a piece of land that doesn't matter you?
And I thought, "Dool. Her mother."
Because this time, it wouldn't be going to go.
L.A. Times got wind from this. Steve Lzzz was talking about the city and talking to a member of Green power. She was a petition on the Chau.org.org, and we were successful with 900 lines.
We thought we had the victory in the hands.
My city actually called it, and said that they support it and love what we do.
So, what's the reason they shouldn't do that?
LA. In the United States, most of the hives in the city are in the owner of the city.
They have 142 miles of the railroad.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough area to plant 72 million tomato nuclei.
Why would they not want to find that?
By growing up a plant, you get 1,000 seeds.
With green beans, you're going to get fruit vegetables and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my boss driver, I'm saying people should grow their food.
His own food is to be able to print its own food.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central Central.
I grew up there. I brought my sons there.
And I'm more confident, part of this unconpicial reality that was made by other people, and I'm going to make a pumping my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
Pace is my graffiti. I'm going to put my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm going to fill, I'm going to go out and I'm going to go to the lawn and the park.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants are the trees, and the trees are my way of making this stuff.
They were surprised to be surprised by what the ground is possible if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunshine is, and how they touch it.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was being a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the floor.
You might be surprised by how kids are influenced by this.
So the deer is the most powerful and the most powerful act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can also get more straw.
I remember this time, when this mother came to her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10 o'clock in my backyard, and I came out and looked out and looked out.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said to them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not reason in the street."
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that was just what I was just committed to to do with people. And people said, "You don't have a fear of your food."
And I said, "Sat the devil, no, I'm not afraid that they're going to blow out.
And it's also on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take care of their health."
I put a garden in this homeless house in L.A.A.
These are the guys who helped me to put the plaster on the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it was, and how they were growing up with her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was, maybe, for a moment.
So Green Griches have already grown up like 20 gardens.
and to look at our origins, those people came up with 50 people and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomato meat, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get it out of it, if they don't show how food and bodies eat, they eat blindly, whatever you're talking about.
I see young people who want to work, but they're sitting in this thing -- I see color-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-white kids who are looking at this thing, and they're looking at the same
The color of the garden is a chance that we can train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carro.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a shipboard and turn it into healthy cafes."
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free fire, because free is not sustainable.
The comal of sustainability is that you have to be engaged by it.
I'm talking about people who are trying to get work and children from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy and enjoy the pride, and the honor of being built when you're building your food, and when you open the markets.
So what I want to do here is to make that sexy.
I want to say that all environmental returns, the gang, the gangmen, the gang-hull.
We need to turn the picture of the gang.
If you're not a shower, you're not a gang.
You're going to have to get a shower with a frer, right?
And let's just take that gun to your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't tell me if you're sitting in a crazy room and you want to make a meeting where you're talking about it, some kind of a pist.
If you want to meet me, you come up with your shake, in my backyard, we can plant any fire.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "Hollyy-nary."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "Hogy" means "n't even a more altruist."
In the 19th century, a new definition of a career, "Moyy is someone who's in the office, regardless of the head of the office, or the program, or the success of the power of the mass-down."
I have no idea what the apartment is."
Something else, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to control language.
171, for example, the British parliament had been released, newspapers didn't have the exact word of the debation.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Cillel Cillel, who was in the parliament.
She put him in the spring of London, and he was brave enough, but he was brave enough to stop the grave, and he finally had so much support in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first result for the sentence "Pelle Books" as well as the Brutar."
Brettes are in the English word for a bus.
But that's not true. It's back to a failure of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to the United States when it's only the independence.
You're looking at the question of how you call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader a foreign nation?
And that's been published in Congress for almost infinite debate.
And there was all sorts of suggestions to make.
I mean, some people would call him the governor Washington, and others, his Mavity Washington, and again, the freeness of the people of America's country.
It's not a kind of a pre-counding thing.
Some people wanted to call him king.
They thought that's not a failure.
They weren't monististic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored in the news because this debate was three weeks ago.
I read the book of a leader that's always writing, "I've been thinking about the same issue.
The reason for the crash was to be angry and the most prolificity of the hospital was against the miner.
The representative drone didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want him to do that.
King, and maybe even to give him ideas to his success.
They wanted to give him the most powerful, unlimient title that they could find.
This is the title of "The Recance."
President. They didn't invent the title. But he didn't mean that someone was running out of a cliff.
This is a kind of a pre-ford of a quot.
He didn't have much size than the "Spime" or "Latal water.
Sometimes, Presidentian genitalial and government groups, but it was a unfinished title.
And so the U.N. refused to get it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up and make foreign police license.
Who will take him seriously if he's got a stupid title like the president of America?"
And then, after three weeks, the U.N. was not going to go to the end of the Senate.
Instead, you don't want to use the "The "The Uncon"" by the end, but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they didn't have to be honest about the altruistic and the possibility of the humanity, whether it's in the state or the state, whether it's not the state of the state, and the person who doesn't mean that the person.
You can learn three interesting things from this.
First of all, and I think that's the best thing to do -- until I can't figure out whether the U.S. has ever been elected by the Dutch minister.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just missed the title. He's just waiting for the U.K. to be active.
And the second thing is, you can learn is that if a government says that something is a temporary, you're going to wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of America's United States is not as hard as it sounds, does it sound so painful, right?
This has something more than 5,000-freating distractions that he has and the largest economy of the world's world and a drone drone drone and all of that stuff.
and reality has given the size of the size.
And that's how the U.K. won the end.
They have a respectful title.
And the other concern about the principal, the head of self-esteem, is now, it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy who is running 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So the end of the Senate won not get the representation of the house because no one feels more gentle when you're told, you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take on what you can take, and I'm going to leave you with that.
Now, politicians are trying to use words to define reality and to control reality, but actually change the reality of the reality as a lot more, than the word, the reality could ever change the reality.
Thank you.
So I came up with a bar with about 50 extrapolation in the fight of Mr. Ahmedabad -- a 15-year-old, vegetarian graffiti from Jacksonville.
I'm looking at my black-sized bag against a pair of fresh leather and a rocket in government war that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a big deal with the war, but next to the Sama party and football and the pist and the pistidial-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-dist-distist-dist-dist-dist-war
But that is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here here, I'm a committed "Bami," South nations of God's "Sirist," and a radical artist who lived the last nine years in Afghanistan, and I'm so on.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan, but I don't like to paint the art, but I want to make art, and I want to fill the character and re-creat the authority and re-creating the reality and re-creating the reality of people who are using a more powerful way of creating the world, and also trying to understand the world.
I want to spend a day of a jihad, a jihad who was using jihad as "Patatat" and his religious and unpaved religious corruption.
And what can be the jihad-speaking man when the parliament was going to do a choice campaign with the tag, "Hould I make it rich."
And to use this campaign to let these Marim-madi-Sadiii, to spend the way they're going to be a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan with a project called "Rilling," where you're going to be a police officer, a false control of the street, and then you're leaving the car out of Kabul, but instead of taking money from the police and you're hoping to take the police in Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become a new conflict in the Intercale conflict.
The war and the religious beliefs that came with him, created a new environment for St.A. and fashion that can only capture by the way to be a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, I would be able to be able to be able to be able to a local farm or a local wet-hift, or a non-dist-dist-dist-dist.
And I would like to see how a simple slick of Kabul looks like the Kigriver of 18 to create a dialogue about how today's development development development development is in the last-century history of the "The Monologian" to protect the black man and even to protect him.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misconrectly misunderstanding.
But I do, because I have to do because the geography of self.
That's my burden. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Samuel, and I've been working for a while as a model.
For 10 years, that's what was happening.
I feel that now in the room, there is a unfinished tension, because I didn't have to be able to wear that dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit more time to change.
This is the first time that someone is going to take a TED stage, so you can appreciate it happy to see this.
If some women were really excited about this, I mean, you don't need to tell me this to say this, I'm going to read on Twitter later.
I also find that I'm very privileged because I can change 10 seconds of thinking about what you think you might be.
It doesn't have any chance to do that.
These are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear it at all.
The most difficult part is to move the sweater over my head, because you're going to keep me all going to do nothing, as long as it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do that?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as uncomfortable as this image.
So a picture is powerful, but a picture is also a super-creen.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And this is a picture -- I had never had a friend in this picture.
I felt very uncomfortable with the photographer, and the photographer told me I was going to put my back oil and my hand into the hair.
And besides the surgery or the wrong shirts that I've been thinking about two days of work, there's very few ways of changing our fears and our "phy" -- although even though it's a huge impact on our lives.
Unless to be honest for me today is to be honest.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my industry, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer now the questions that people always ask me, but to be honest.
The first question is, "How are you going to make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy, and maybe you might ask what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we don't only define beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, that we're programmed to be biologically engineered, but also as big as a man, a patrioid, a soul, and a bright-in-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's committed for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion callers, "Hoy, Katan. Look, yama. Look.
And I'm just talking about the model of the model. It's very impressive.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, the first year of the RISD student has been a very ambitious doctor that all the way to the run, each one that was cut, and that in fact, 145 percent of the time, there were less than two percent.
The next question that always asks me is, "Can I be a model if I am grown?"
And I'm saying, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give this little girl really is, why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can be President of the U.S. or the inventor of the Internet or a Ninst-math surgeon who was completely wrong, because you're the first one."
When they say that great score, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American bird, or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meis.
And you say, you want to be a model later, as if you're saying that the Jack's license is going to win the Swow.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of model-based model, because as a heart surgeon can now be able to turn it back.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice laser, and the client says, "Conon, we want to go to a picture of the day, then the leg is fast, and then you go back to the back, the arm is moving back to the back, and you're going to the back, and you're going to see 300 friends, and then you're going to see, and you're going to see
It looks like this.
I hope that it's less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you're going to win and you've done a life and a few jobs, you can't say much more, and if you say that President's president is going to be the U.S., but you're going to look at 10 years, you'll see that in the room, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see, you're going to be weird.
The next question that often asks me is, "Who are all the photos going to be?"
And yes, so all of the photos are turned into, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the first time I was wearing a Biniini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
And I just saw a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the song.
My friend had to come up with me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days ago from a nightmare for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-D magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not images of me.
They're constructed, and they're a group of professionalists, from Hagaylist and the studio and the photographers and the pistists and the pists and the petist and the pets, and they're not. I'm not.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "Do you have things free?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-minute flaps that I can't wear, but just the things I'm going to make is free, things that I'm going to get in real life, and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and you had a drink for free.
When I was a teenager, I went to my friend with a terrible driver, and she was leaving the red light, and of course, we were stopped. It only took a "gar, Mr. Teszler," and we could go back.
I've paid this cost of things because of my appearance and not because of my personality and people who look like their appearance and not pay attention to their personality.
I live in New York and I've been walking out of the 140 teenagers that were thrown out in the last year, and I've been smoked, 85 percent of black black black and Latino and young men.
It's not only 17,000 young young young men and Latino who don't ask the question, "Who am I going to stop?"
But, "How often am I going to be fired?" When I'm going to stop it?"
In my research of this talk, I found that the 53 percent of the girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number is up to 7 percent, when they're 17 percent old.
The last question to me is, "How is it to be a model?"
And I think they expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and bright hair, then you feel very happy and beautiful."
And we give a response that might be given to this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel, and it's great to work with creative, inspired people."
It's true, but it's just half the story, because what we never say about the camera, what I never said before, is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about what my view is every day.
And if you ever ask, "Do I happier if I had a thin legs and a bright hair?"
You'd want to make a few modules because they have the most thin legs and the bright hair and the cool flail, and they're the same thing because of their women's most vulnerable women on the planet.
And when I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to keep me to move a serious balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to say, "I got all the benefits out of a boat that he felt very good." And it doesn't feel very good." And it feels like that.
It was very difficult to share a legacy of abuse and race when I was one of the biggest uses of the police.
But I'm happy and happy to be honored here, and I think it's great that I've done this here before 10 or 30 years, and my career is still unfinished, because I would not tell you how my job was, or I would not be paid to be paid, and I'm happy, which is so important.
If you take this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our instincts and the misconcession.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who had gone to life, "Son, Lafi, Lafi's resistance.
But never will have to be a guy like a Goyafafi revolution."
It's almost two years since the Fothian revolution, inspired by the waves of mass-creating and in the wild-scale revolution.
I was forced to speak with many other savals, and in outside, to try to bring a day of anger and start a revolution against the tyrant regime.
And it was, a great revolution.
Boy, al-law and men were in the first row, and the end of the regime was, the Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've described an extraordinary courage by being asked by the brutal dictator of Gafafz.
They have a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the far north, until the south.
After a period of six months of brutal war, almost 50,000 dead deaths, it made us go to free our country and the tyrant.
Now, the head of the man has left a great burden, a legacy of the tyris, the corruption and the foundation.
Over the years, Gafafophannian regime and the infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the wy-shaped society.
The destruction and the challenges, I realized how many women were building the civil society of Lyyzas, and we asked a permanent and sustained democracy and a global state of democracy.
Now, in fact, 200 organizations were turned into the case of Gafafis in Ben Hibu, almost 300 in Trillolis.
After 33 years in the exor, I came back to Lyy, and I started to organize with unique enthusiasm, and I started to organize the work of the public capacity, human development, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peacebuilding community, a movement of women, leaders of different life-making, their goal, is to be the dominant for the creation of women, to be the dominant and to our status of democracy.
In the case of the election, I met a very difficult environment that was increasingly influenced by polarized, a environment that was defined by the selfish politics of dominance.
I was offered a initiative of peacebuilding, and I was going to try to get women to get a choice, a law of the citizens, no matter what the background should be, and to put the law on the side of the line and to try and put a gender line between a female and a gender line and a number of female and a market.
And the end of the initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's state in the first elections for 52 years.
But long, the war of the elections and the whole revolution, because every day we were thinking about new news from violence.
And we went to the news of the man's head of ancient mosques and the Sufi and the poets.
In another morning, we got the message about the murder of American ambassador and the attack on the message.
After another morning, the suicide bombed was signed by the army.
And it's really true that we're going to keep the law of the military and their ongoing, to fight against the human victims and their mispoodings of laws.
Our society is formed by a revolutionary mind, polarized, and moved from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, and the other one that they had been looking at.
Beaction, and Rood became the icon of the <unk>Fol<unk> War."
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success of our history of our success and the elections.
I'm more interested in this today that we've been told that as a nation, the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We've answered our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't have peace or safety in Lyia.
Did the hard and the shift between female and female peace and national peace and national war?
No, that doesn't have it.
What is it?
Why is our society going to continue to be de-in-in-fist-fist-fist-fist-fist-fist-s-s-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the
Maybe the women were not the only thing that was wrong, but the female values of compassion, the Good and the union.
Our society needs to be a national dialogue and a visualization process as it needed to have the elections that only has the polarization and the mutatory.
Our society needs to have the sexual embodiment of the female as they need the standard, negative, negative, negative, the female.
We need to stop the shame of the anger and to ask a day of the revenge.
We need to start with the compassion and the eternity.
We need to develop a female discourse that is not only responsible for the values, but also to resist: Hoodess, instead of working, instead of a competition, rather than a gun.
These are the ideals that have to be able to get a war out of the war, to get peace to peace.
Because peace has an alchemy and in this alchemie, it's about the defension of the feminist and the pelels of the vony.
That's the real disbelief.
And that's what we need to do with, before we do it, we do it with sociology.
After a re-ford of the Koran "Salam" -- "The word of the Sist of God, hysterical."
The word "The "The Mind" is known in all the Islamic traditions, the same Arabic root of the character as "The mother" and symbolically, the dominant man, the whole man, the female, the female, the female and the female, and the female.
And just like the mother's embryo that grows in his brain, completely, is the reason of compassion is the same existence of compassion.
And so we said, "My Goodah, all things are going to be a bit."
And so we said, "My Goodgard was in front of my gentleman."
So let's make sure that all the gains of the Goode will be the most vulnerable.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best thing in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In the school, we're looking at the story of Kim Me-I, but we've not learned a lot about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my life in North Korea to go through a change of everything.
I saw seven years old, and I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a sister's sister.
And she said, "If you're standing here, our family members aren't more of the world, because we've never eaten nothing for two weeks.
We're in the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard that people were suffering in my country for the first time.
And I was just waiting for this to the train, and I saw something horrible about it that I couldn't get away from my memory.
A pistic woman on the ground, and a broken child in her arm was laughing in her arm, and they were laughing in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy to care about their families and their families.
In the mid-'9s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
In the end, there was more than a million North Koreans who were listening to victims, and many more and more and more of them survived because they ate grass, and the tree is eating.
Luges are increasingly likely to be worse, so that night, the lights of China on the other side of the river, where we lived.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the orchestra, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vulnerable and allow the droughts to escape.
But many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies moving into the river.
I can't tell you about how North Korea was left, but I can say that I was sent to the death of the death of the dead years to get away from China.
I just thought I was separated by my family for a short time.
I never thought that it had 14 years to go back to life.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how the life was going to be as the Northsturian refugee, but soon I learned that it's not very difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Asian refugees are seen as illegal refugees in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
And one day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught up by the Chinese police police and being attacked in the police department.
Somebody was encouraged to be a woman, Northstore, so they tested my Chinese and asked me a lot of questions.
I had such fear, and I thought my heart would explode.
And if anything unnatural would seem to be trapped and hidden.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made my feelings to control my feelings and answer the questions.
After they got done with the evaluation, a leader said, "That was a wrong deal.
She's not Northwest."
And they left me. It was an wonder.
Now, some North Koreans, he's looking at foreign messages in China likeylyl, but many of the police police are caught and shot.
These girls had great luck.
Even though they're caught, they finally released by tremendous international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so lucky.
Every year, there are countless North Korea in China, and they're already released to North Korea where they're being executed or thrown into public or publicly.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, there's a lot of North Carolina in the world.
It's tragic that North Koreans are hiding their identity and hard to fight and fight for survival.
After she's learned a new language and work, her world can be turned into the head.
After 10 years of the shock, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I went to South Korea, a bigger challenge when I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea, that I had to start learning my third language.
And I also realized that the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but we've been very close to the outside of the other side, because of the 42 years of the process.
I went through a identity crisis.
Am I a South or Northwest leader?
Where am I? Who am I?
And suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the instability of the South Bronx didn't realize very easily, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording of university.
I was just as a new life-sized life, I received a scary call.
The North Netherlands started taking the money that I sent my family, and as a punishment, my family forced me to move into a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to go back to the freedom of the freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I was making me go back to the northwest border.
Because my family didn't talk about Chinese, I had to fund them, and it was going to be used to travel over 2,000 miles through China, and then back to South Asia.
The bus station took a week, and we'd almost get caught in a lot of times.
Once the bus was sent to the bus, a Chinese police police police police officer.
He took the mix of all of you, and he started asking questions.
My family didn't understand Chinese, I thought she was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer was elected by my family, I decided to be a car, and he said that she was a lip, and I was a sign of her.
He looked at me, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to be able to the oatist border, but I had to spend all my money to get the border of Lus Lus.
But even after we've been rejected, my family was unrated, because of illegal border.
After I paid money and a prison, my family was released in a month, but after my family, my family was reacted, in the capital of Lora.
This was one of the biggest revelations of my life.
I had done everything to keep my family's freedom, and we were so close to that, but my family was arrested, just after the South Bronx's South Bronx.
I went out and I went across the battlefield and the police department, trying to quit my family, but I had no money to pay money to pay money to pay money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised to be a stranger's party.
In a broken English and I explained to a dictionary, and I went to the bank and paid the money for my family to get two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I was very grateful with him from my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you." He said, "I'm going to be a "m going to help."
"I'm going to help the North Bronx."
I realized that this was a symbolistic moment in my life.
The earlier strangers of mine had to have a new hope that the North Koreans needed to have so much to be so powerful, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the most profound community, the North Koreans need to have.
And finally, after our long journey, my family and I moved back to South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come into a new country, they start with nothing or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, to learn English, to learn the job education and a lot of more.
We can also be able to change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world because a lot of us are still in contact with families, and we send them information to change the water that helps North Korea.
I was so lucky to get all of the help and inspiration in my life that I want to be able to re-fow my late Northwest peacebuilding, to support international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, but also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just got a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good at the very good.
He can't talk, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to share it, and he's putting it in the field of his own.
He's not a cist. He doesn't look at the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and you just ask yourself, he never told a lie.
When he sang songs from our childhood, he tries to be trying to remember that I remember, and he reminds me of a thing: how little we know about the minds and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's very good. He's very good at the screen.
He has a absolutely unconable memory.
He also has a selective organ.
He can't remember if he's stolen chocolate, but he remembers the paper of his song from the iPod that we had, when he was four times as a result of the paterpard, and his mother's birthday.
Don't listen to it?
But many people don't agree.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they often miss and wrong.
But what struck me was that my soul was empowered, although that was the case, although it was not considered usual, it only meant that it was extraordinary -- it was an autistic, and it was extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who don't know with the term "cacism" is a complex disorder of the brain, the social communication, the learning of learning and the physical abilities.
It's also a different aspect of every individual, so it's a part of Michaeli, as Sam.
And the world will be discovered in a new person with a new autism, and although it's a growing development of development development in the world, there's no evidence of healing or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm a kid, but I can't remember myself without the day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He's very much good.
He didn't want to play the same babies, and he didn't really seem to be interested in me.
Michaeli lived in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like cars in a row in the room to eat and eat everything that was coming from him.
And as he was older, the differences were visible and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the shaman, and the seemingly unbioid activity was something that was really unique: a seemingly innocent nature and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without the limitations of the world, a human who never had never been.
It's not surprising.
Now, I can't believe that there was some more challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish that they were as a matter.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that things are not supposed to be against normal equality.
So, the normality of the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we're different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there is a different kind of right there.
And if I could only tell you a thing about Remii and Sam, then it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not the differences that we have -- we have a gift of us! Everyone has a gift of us. And in the honesty of honesty, the norm of normality is the ultimate potential of self.
The chance of scale, progress and change in the moment where we try to be as someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Edocon has been engaged with curiosity, with this photograph of a pilot through a apple and a loss of air-long air pressure only a hundredth-century second.
But now 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world not with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography that can make the FFFFMMMM drone, a new engineering technology that's so fast that it can create a slow-speed light of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look at the outside of our view or see a <unk>-ray image in our bodies and really ask what we do with the camera.
Now, if I take a laser, and I take it in a second-by-by-half-half-by-half-half-by-half-step, it's a piece of photographs that's hardly a thin-sized piece of photot, and this is going to move the light, and that is when I'm going to make a normal project, and it's like a normal project.
So if you take this project, this photot-tap-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this event --
So think that this event actually takes less event than a nanototot -- so long as the light takes to take the route, but I'm going to try to make this video to make the 10 billion billion of the neurons that you see in the movement.
No, Coca-Cola has not funded this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of stuff happens, so let me show you what's going on.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle with a photon of photon, starts to move through the river, and then the end of the inside.
A part of the light is going to turn out on the table, and you see that spread of waves.
Many of the photons are ultimately going to break the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's moving around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table, and because of the reflection of the screen, the reflection of the reflection of the reflection of the bottle is focused on a few pictures.
Now, if you take a common project and you take the same route back and you can slow the video back to 10 billion times, you know how long you have to sit here, and then you have to see the film here?
Day one day, a week? No, a year.
This would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in movement.
And what does it look like with a more silent life photographer?
You can see again, the waves of the table, the Tom and the wall down in the background.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature of the universe, a photo of a F-Rod, but of course, the eye looks like a picture of our eye.
But if you look at this Tom's lunch, then you'll see that when the light stops the light of Tom's breath, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because Tom is still left, and the light is coming up and then after a hundred seconds, it's coming back.
So in the future, if this F-M-M-M-Moyy camera is built in your garage, it might be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if a fruit is not even touching it.
So how did my team build this camera?
So as a photographer, as a photographer, you know, if you're doing a picture of air long-term air, you have very little light, but we're going to have a billion times faster than the long-term air, so you're going to get the light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, and we're going to draw this satellite, and I'm going to draw it back a thousand-and-a-half-half-half-half-dimensional, and then we'll try to do this with very smart synchronization of data, and we'll actually combine this video.
And we can take all of these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but what would it be like to be a new superpower for a future-sized superheras?
The idea is that we're going to turn something back to the door.
It's going to turn it into the room, a part of it will turn back to the door, and then eventually, back to the camera, and we could be able to re-cuse these more and more light-sensitive light-like light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, our Fto-MM camera.
The wall is hidden in the wall, and we're going to turn the light back to the door.
After our paper was published in the Deval Movement, it was made by Nature.com.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to turn these light project back, and they're going to turn that wall, and these photons are going to be trapped in all directions, and some of the photons will be able to be able to turn the light, again, the light will be broken, and then again, again, a tiny part of the ceiling will be able to turn back to the camera, but then they're going to be able to be able to turn it back to the light
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Fto-MMM camera has a unique skill.
She has a very good time of thermosponom, and she can look at the world in light.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So if we can turn a laser, we can take a raw picture of how they look on the screen -- not really make sense, but if we take a lot of these pictures, and then try to analyze the light of the light, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We've got a lot of things to do before we can actually fix the laboratory, we could avoid cars, and see what's left on the curve, or we can look for the loss of death, and then we can look at the light, and we can see that we can actually turn the window into the back of the wall, or we can see the wall in the wall, and the wall, and the wall, and the wall, and the wall is going to be able
But because of the blood and tissues, of course, that's really challenging, why is this a call call call for scientists now thinking about FFTMMM, because there's a new imaging process that could actually solve the next generation of medical development.
So, like Docon, even a scientist, is a art of the ultra-speed photograph, and I realized that all of these data, we can't collect a new sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence, and we can't only do a new sequence of the memory of the light, and that you can see that the light of the light and the light, and that you can see that light.
But it's also a funny thing about this.
If you look at the waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves move away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost recording in light, weird effects and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly amazing.
The order of the sequence in the world is going to appear in the camera, by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So don't think whether to be able to focus around photography or to focus a new visual representation of medicine or new forms, since we've been able to open and open the data and open up and hope that the design of the research and the design of the research that we need to be able to show you that we need to be in the next one, and that we're going to be able to be able to be able to look at the data.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of how our people can improve our lives.
We don't really meet every neighbors on the street so many people can't be passed by the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like a little bit of a stick, and to use the chalk and the chalk.
The projects were made by my questions, how much money do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without listening to each other?
How can we share our memories of buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for living houses so that our communities and our dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is completely disregular by the giant es that had been able to give some loved loved loved loved loved, drunk and shade, and I trust a city of a city where music is always held.
I think every time someone never has a seat, there's a middle of New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful building in the world, but it's also the city that's left most of our houses in America.
I live near this house and I thought, how I can make it, and I thought, I thought, it's always changed in my life.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Manan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking about death, and I felt a great gratitude about my life, and it brought me a clarity about things that are important to me now in life.
But it's hard to keep that view of time on the day.
It's easy to lose in the daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the house and wrote a little blackboard with a rach of the gaps, "I want to live on the floor, I want to go back and think, I can take a piece of life and think about his dreams.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the window was completely filled with the wall, and it grew up.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the people in the wall.
I'm going to die, I want to be disolted for piracy."
I want to be hungry, I want to be close to the International Recield."
I want to sing for millions of people."
I want to feed a tree."
I'm going to die. I want to live in the grid."
I want to keep hungry, I want to keep myself in my poor."
I'm going to die. I want to be a person's artwork."
I want to die. I want to be myself."
This seemingly unfinished place was taken into a meaningful place, and the dreams of people brought me to laugh and to the wine and to the cold times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and in a new way, and it's a way of thinking about it.
It's about creating a space for the idea and to remember what is most important than we grow and changing.
I've done this last year, and hundreds of news people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a construction plant, and now in the world of South Dakazan, Australia, Australia, and other walls.
We've shown that as much power of our public spaces, if we have the opportunity to keep our voices and share more with others.
So the two of the most valuable things we have is time and the relationships of other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to look at things with the right view and think that life is very sensitive and sensitive.
We're often not going to talk about death or just thinking about it, but I realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that we're most vulnerable to.
The idea of death is what life really does.
Our common spaces are the best places that are important as individuals and as community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories that people can't help us to be better places to help us be better and better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm trying to criticize a very special problem for everyone who's busy working on the idea of being a professional math, that we're like business-making.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing today.
Stock is one of the most human activity.
We're excited about the pro-founding ball and the hives as you're going to see.
Now, the ball is a remarkable amount of knowledge and abilities, and it might be a basic prediction that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's process, and that's what it does in my grandmother's love, Janel, who was a ball of his time-to-day pig.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unhealthy symptom of how the weaknesses and the dony and the other things that we need to discover that disease is too critical to discover the disease before it is.
We need to measure the progress of objective objective, and ultimately, the only way to know whether it's cure, if we have a objective amount of magnitude to answer that question.
Now, in trouble, it's anti-exving and other movements, you don't have a simple blood analysis, so the best thing is, which is that this 20-year-old test is the neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside of clinical studies that never will never be done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a professional tour of mine. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't have to make a hospital service.
It costs 300 percent to look at the neurologic unit.
So I want to propose to you a non-conventical method that we're trying to do with, because we're all in a certain sense of virtual, virtual, like my name of mine.
Here's a video of the vibrant mood.
This is what happens in the healthy state, when someone wrote a speech, we can look at the ugly ball of fire-wook, because we have to deal all of these voices, if we could make sound, and we all have the genes for the CSM.
And as ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it starts.
And we can determine the position of the nerve signals, and as the ant is affected, the mood of Parkinson's brain is affected by Parkinson's muscles.
On the bottom, you can see an example of unconcular blind-sensitive mood analysis.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
It's a myth, it's cater, it's a shame.
The language is even more blind and lonely and lonely, and this is an example of a rebiologist.
Now, this impacts on the voice, sometimes with digital microphones and analysis, combined with new machine-controlled machine processing, which is now very advanced, so we can see where someone is in between a pist, and only because of the brain, and the mood, and the mood of the voice.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not the same self-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-created. The test is that the neurologists are.
It's not very small. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And they're both accurate. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done in their own.
They're very fast, very high, very low-speed seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large amount of magnitude.
So this amazing goals can be done now.
We can reduce the math problem for patients.
So patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from the historical observation.
We can do low-cost mass support for clinical trials, and we could actually take a study of the entire population to really be able to do this.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomaterials before the disease is too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step, we're going to start the Parkinson's disease.
With Ax and patient's brain, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough speed data to make it happen for the potential of these goals.
We have a call of the news that is available on the three-quarters of people on the planet.
Anyone who is using Parkinson's disease, can call you cheap images for a few cents. I'm afraid that we've already lost six percent of our goal in eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of it, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What do you do to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to be told as a call call, whether this person is suffering or suffering or not. OK.
Maybe they may not be able to create the end.
But we collect a huge database in which different circumstances are interesting. These conditions are important, because we're actually going to turn that position to figure out what the actual sign is for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, your 86 percent accuracy is?
It's much better than that.
My students, I have to put it up because he's done so fantastic work, now, that it's working on the cell phone system, which is allowing us to do what this project is, and we're 99 percent of the accuracy.
This is what I call a improvement.
That means that people can call the phone, and they can call the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, send their voice to the heart of the disease so that your doctor can monitor the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Jake and gentlemen and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live here. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows in the background, and the tea behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is actually just a set of culial in the South, and that means that wildlife communities can leave as the helas of the park at any time.
The predators that follow the lions, and then they follow it. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night, and I woke up in the morning, and she found dead. It was terrible. It was our only cow.
My tribe, the tribe of the Asian, believe that we came together with our animals and the jungle of the sky, so that's why our animals mean so much.
I learned as a child to hate lions.
Our warrior are protected. They protect our tribe and our ancestors. They're also also supported by this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's only a black-state park, and there's only so few lions.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years of his father was responsible for his father. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wasn't really going to help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't have any. I went on.
I had a second idea. I tried to look at a bird.
I wanted to think that the lions thought I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You'll see the bird, and then go back and forth, and the next time you come back, and they're going to come, the thing is not going to move, it's not even there.
And they're going to take the impact of our livestock.
And one night I stopped the skace. I went around with a pelpard and it was walking around the side of the boat, and this time the lions don't know.
And the lion is afraid of light, it moves.
I had a idea.
I worked on my room as a young boy, and once he took the new radio radio of my mother apart, and the day, he was almost interested in electronics.
I took a old car battery and a motor drive from a motorcycle, and the one shows if you want to turn your left or left. It's blinking.
And I got a switch to turn the lights and turn the lights.
This is a little bit of a pelpard of a broken bag.
And then I built all of these together.
The solar elephant is taking the battery, the electricity takes the electricity to the server. I call it a propulsion.
And the correct bee is glowing.
You can see that the pelps are coming out of the outside, because the lions come out there.
And this is what happens to the lions when they come.
The lights are shining and the lions believe that I'm going to go to the skill, and that's where I was going to go to bed.
Thank you.
I've been running this in our home, and since we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard of it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals, and she asked me if I could put the lights on the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've been growing up in the neighborhood seven houses with the lights, and they're really good at the lights.
Now, my idea is now used in Kenya, also for other predators like Hyshids or leopard seals, and the lights also be used to keep elephants from sea.
My invention was given me a scholarship in Kenya, Brookhouse School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is committed to donations and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights there where there are no one, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
A year ago, I was just a boy who was crying by his father's cows. I saw planes about me and said, "Ead, day, I'm going to sit in a room."
And here I am standing here.
I had to be a plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a pilot and a pilot, that's my great dream.
I used to be a witness. But by my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can live together with the lions, without the argument.
Elizabeth Ol<unk>. In my language, that means, "Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you're listening to your eyes.
So you have this scholarship. Yeah.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next list on the list?
So my next invention, now, I work on a electric fence. A electrocist?
Yeah, I know that electrical pids have been invented long ago, but I want to have my own.
You've just tried it, right, yeah, I've tried this, but the trial had given me back, because I got a break.
Right. Richard Turer, you're quite special.
We're going to be feeding you every step of your house, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm old enough to keep a camera in the hand, my photography, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and not one of them.
There was no kind of a masterist, no style, no one can even get a picture of it. It's not even the lighting of the air.
To be honest, most of them were shot by the historical tourists.
My story begins as a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture, where I was at my daughter's birthday, and we were at the corner of 57 and five and five.
So a year later, we went back to New York, and we decided to even shoot the same picture once.
Well, you can see what's going on --
As the third birthday of my daughter said, "Hey, why don't you go to New York to New York and do a father's father's son's son, who's going to lead the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, how universal the gesture is when you're going to have a completely stranger with your camera.
Nobody ever said that he's lucky and he's never even left with the camera with the camera.
And at the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened next day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a missepord moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us in October of October, and to change our time and how we're going to change our year, not just to be physically, but to be in real, but to be in all.
Because even though we do the same image, our perspective of time, as they're going to achieve new corridors, I can see the life of their eyes, as they do, and how they look, they see it.
This very intense time that we spend is something that we appreciate and expect every year.
So, as a travel, we walked out of our travel, and suddenly, it turns out that it shows a red ball on a flash like a kid who had learned as a kid, when I was born in the earlier days.
And she told me about their feelings that she had had been as five-year-old about this point.
She said she remembers her heart of her chest when she saw the store at nine years ago,
And now she looks at high school schools in New York because she really wanted to study in New York City.
And I realized that the most important thing that we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role of memory from memories.
I don't know what it looks like, but from this 15 pictures, I'm not very much of a family photograph.
I'm always the picture of this.
I want to encourage you to come to this image and not just ask someone, "Do you want to make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 19.83, 50.6/26.3/15.0/8.7 (BP=0.972, ration=0.972)
