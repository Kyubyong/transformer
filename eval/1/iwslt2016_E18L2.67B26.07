When I was 11, I was blown away one morning from the sounds of the bright joy.
My father listened to his little, terrible radio show from the BBC.
He was very happy at what was rather unusual at the time, because he was most likely to be angry by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban's power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so for five years I was huddled as a boy, and I was left with my older sister who was no longer allowed to date alone in a secret school.
It's the only way we could go to school.
And every single day, we took another way, so that no one could guess where we were going.
We put our books in a shopping bag, so it looks like we're just going to run.
We've been served in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of neat, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew we were risked by our lives: teachers, students, our parents.
After all, all of a sudden, the class had to be out for a week because the Taliban had a badge.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued both daughters.
My grandfather was well-known in his time.
One of the outsiders from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to get to school, and was distracted by his father.
My mother grew up, but she became a teacher.
That's what they are.
She was in the middle of England two years ago just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- and here, was the first person in his family to ever get an education.
It was always obvious for his children to be educated, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
and he saw it as a much larger risk to not sending his children to school.
I still know that in the years I was so frustrated by the Taliban, sometimes so frustrated by our lives, by the perpetual fear and perspectiveless.
I was very good to give up, but my dad said, "Tdaughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing you're going to always remain, which is what's in there. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed in the centuries of war.
Less than six percent of women of my age have higher degree than the high school degree, and if my family hadn't used so much for my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I stand here today as a proud exor at the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was released from his family, because he failed to send his daughters to school, one of the first congratulations that I was congratulated.
And I'm not just joking at graduate, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the one who drives him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even more dreams for me.
That's why I am the global ambassador of 10x10, a world campaign for women's education.
And so I helped start to start, you know, SOLA, the first, and maybe only real Internet service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school girls are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school are going to be so great, very ambitious to all of them want to be aware of potential opportunities.
And seeing their parents and fathers stand for them, including my parents, despite all odds, despite all odds.
And as Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is one of my students' father.
just a month ago, and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and they were killed by a bomb on the side of the road for just a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang up, and a voice threatened to say that if he left his daughter back to school, they would try again.
And he said, "Well, if you want me now, I'm not going to put my daughter's future in the game for you, because of your old-trenched and over-exfived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that's often going to be wrong in the West: behind most of us, who have a success, is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and is aware that their success is also success.
I don't mean that our mothers don't want to play an important role in our success.
They're often often the ones who are once-evolved and compelling in the future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely essential.
And under the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears, from America, so different.
Americans recognize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not longtime, and they're changing everything with the citizens of the United States.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, who are encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me, a country of hope, and the unbridled possibility, and remember the girl every single day, going to the SOLA.
And just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as I'm a profession -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
1971 to 1977, I look very young, but I'm not -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on technical projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO project, and I failed every single project that we put on my legs.
I was desperate.
I mean, 21 years ago, we thought we were good people, and we were very good at making good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we used to do.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book in Bambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias to be raised of food.
We got to the almond crop in South Zambia, in this weird valley, which leads to Sambesi-Sat. We taught local citizens how to grow Italian tomato sauce and pcini.
Of course, the local people had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were surprised that there was no such a fertile valley that was ominous.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank goodness we're here!"
Voice 2: Just in time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these magnificent tomato sauce. In Italy, they got so big, so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the queens, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato cells were mature and red, about 200 carners were coming out of the river and they were laughing.
We said to the Sambenns, "Oh God, the numper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so excited in Italy, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the English world did, and then I saw what they did, and then I saw what they did, I was pretty proud to be in our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the uterus.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've given to our African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a multigian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given a trillion dollars of a billion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what that money did.
Just read your book.
Think about a African woman who did what we did.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we hypnotize them, we are patriarchists.
Both words come from the Latin root, which means "pater" means "bater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I'm going to treat every other culture as if they were my children. I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm going to treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bwana," head.
I got excited when I read the book "Sylley" of Shayer. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, they will calm down.
That should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
And this morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the floor, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolalized?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just react to people, and I created a system called the U.S. government, where never will ever be launched, never will anyone be motivated, but you will become the service of local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you sit down with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We find ourselves in cafes. We meet in bars.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to close with friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like it, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in human history.
We're going to help them find knowledge because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I had this one case many years ago: Why would it happen to come to a community and say to people what they should do, why don't we listen to them? Not in community collectors.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Entrepreneurs never have a part of it, and they'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Let's have that blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never seem to be in public meetings.
We're working on one thing to do that, we have to make a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital hospital in the house with you guys sitting in your kitchen table and the coffee shop, helps you find the means to transform your passion in a way of transforming your life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was a doctor who was now trying to escape the disengage, the way we say to others what to do.
And so I went all over the streets in the first three days, and within the first three days, my first customer, and I helped him. He was a new fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then he came to the fishermen, and said, "You helped me help us?" Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishermen work together, and I didn't sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany, 60 cents <unk>Kilo, but I went to Japan for a sushi for 15 dollars. Then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you make <unk>"?" I said, "I do something very, very hard.
I'm holding the mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- -- So the government says, "Let's try again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been working with 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies who are going to go to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best CEO of history, died by 96 years ago.
Peter's C.D. professor, before he was working on companies, Peter put in the computer, he said, "You know, programming is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So programming is the death of the entrepreneur spirit.
So you build Christchurch, and you can't know what the smartest person Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get them to get you.
You have to offer them discretionion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come in there.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who have intelligence and passion?
What I'm most excited about today is this morning?
"Sear, passionate people. You applaud that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- misguided fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal power engine is not sustainable.
The open-off of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, create, transport, and share them with them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
Government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a prehistoric magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to discuss the future of the city in New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and speculated what would happen in the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was that New York City was not going to exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grew on this rate, they needed six million horses to get people to do it, and it was impossible to get them done with six million horses.
Because they were already under the crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that makes life look like New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automobile companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little small factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you need to be offered to them some discretion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, dedicated and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of them have to do three things: to sell the product, it has to be grand, it has to be grand market, it has to be great, and it has to be huge.
You guess what?
We never met one person who can make something, and then they can sell for money.
That's not true of the same.
That person was never born.
We've done research and looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been common, one: none of them were founded by one person.
We now teach 16 year-old students in North Britain, and we start teaching them to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransonsith Autographics, and the task is 16-year-old, in the first two pages of Richard Bransian's autobiography, often how he uses the word "h" and often "we" as a word.
Never "I" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where a group of developers have a small, small community in cafes and Bars. They're dedicated to their partners who are going to do what someone in this gentleman's talk about this epist, who's going to tell you. Somebody who's going to say, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting organizations to help them find the means and people. We've found that the miracle of the intelligence of the local population is causing culture and the economy to change only by the one of the passion, the energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
I was five years ago, and I've heard how it should be, why I think, Alice, in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to try to connect high-tech engineers into communication.
I was scared.
I'm really afraid. I'm afraid of those students with their large brains and their large books and their large, I'm not trusting words.
But when the conversation evolved, it was like Alice, when she was strapped down to the eye for the guest, and a door was on a new world.
And I also felt that when I was talking to the students, I was amazed by the idea that they had, and I wanted to find that other miraculous country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our greatest problems, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go. I think that it's our responsibility as a non-religativeist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please stand up.
So I want to show you a few more approaches of how you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're engaged with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, okay?
Let's tell you why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only do we say that their grazing is being studied, but what it tells us is that their graves, their pertilation structure, our bones, are examined because it's important to understand and treat osteisisisis.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to have any kind of dispute.
Now, the rules of speech are a barrier to the understanding of your thoughts.
I mean, surely you could use your "op-time" and "happy", but why don't you just say "Space and time" -- which is much more understandable for us?
And so to make your mind understand is not the same as you should beat your level down.
As Einstein said earlier, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can tell us something about your scientific area without having to deal with any tradeoffs.
So one of the things that I'm going to do is to take some examples, examples, stories and analogies. So this is how you can get you into your closet.
And if you present your work, let's take the hits away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "Stend point?"
What happens when someone stands? Another one is going to be weeks, and with these dots, the first one is your audience.
Now, a slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the scientific information of our brain, and that's how we're very quickly advancing.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the graft is so robust that it even became the inspiration of the unique design of the Eiffvezer.
The trick is here, using a single, simple, read-reading sentence where the audience can, once it loses the thread, or color it, use images and graphs that also makes our other senses more appealing, and therefore creates a deeper understanding of what it is that you describe.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open those door and see the wonderland that science and technology are coming in.
Because the engineers I've been teaching have taught me to put the "Nerd" in me, I want to sum up all of this in an equation.
Look at your science of your numbers and your discourse, they share it through the popularity, so the audience says what's important, and they multiply that with the passion that you have for incredible work, and it's a remarkable interaction with new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm very much comfortable with it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can do a drug with a cell phone, and you can actually film a crime in Syria.
You can tweet a phone, and launch a news and start a protest in Egypt.
And you can record a song with a cell phone, upload it in the sound cloud and get famous.
All of that is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this town.
You can see there, like hundreds of thousands of people went on the street for change, showing.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we asked ourselves that all these people who were coming in and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot of them. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone, and how my life has changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
That's 35.830 lines are full of information.
You can do raw data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. missionary has launched a policy line.
So the right line is called the U.S. Protection Protection Act.
The rule is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service service service in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who calls you? Who calls an email?
Who gets a text message from who's going to talk?
And when you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet phone service company,
And all over Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want that."
They said, we don't want this legal supply to this country.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone company and Internet services to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of them said, "We don't want that."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people were wandering around the streets of Berlin, saying, "Brity instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be at the point of Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the head of Occicei in Eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering, is this really going to work?
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone, I'm using it?
So I asked my phone company, the Deutsche, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, I ask them, I'd send all the information you've saved on me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and she didn't get a right answer. Just give me a different blues. Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's on top of it.
So I decided to put a trial on them because I wanted to have that information.
But the German telecom said, no, we're not going to give you that information.
And it ended up with a comparison to them.
I'm going to pull back the rule of what they were asking me to send information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court determined that the E.U. base was a law enforcement line.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD is this.
35.830 lines of information.
I first saw it, and I said to myself, well, it's a huge file. My house.
But then I realized after a while, that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do you want to start with it?
Because you see where I am, sleeping at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what the U.S. Council of Honurance means.
So with time and open data town, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, and zoom in, and you can go back and forth.
You can follow every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I drove from Frankfurt to the train to the sand oil, and how many calls I'm making.
And all of that is possible with this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I'm calling my wife up, and she calls me, and we're going to talk a couple of times.
And then some friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call yourself and you call them, and we have this huge network of communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, what time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see anything.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
That's a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who's talking to who you're talking to, who gets an email, all of that is possible when you have access to that information.
And that information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we would imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their bag.
And the Stasi would have known, who was on the demonstration, and if the stamps knew who the leader had been, that maybe this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin wall might not have happened.
And then again, the fall of the iron curtain.
Because today's national agency and companies want to store so many information as they can get about us, online and Internet-based.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, say your congressive, just because companies and state countries have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to struggle for your own self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral shops, rapid restaurants, bricks.
So the city planners come together and they decided to change the name of South Central, so that it's true for something else, it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Cultical stores, rapid restaurants, bricks.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert town of South Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivetus and the Drivebys.
The thing is, the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drive-bys.
People in South Central Los Angeles die of curable disease.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is higher than five times in Beverly Hills, about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really see that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, if you go out of the house, you see the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I've taken the chairs and I've been bought and sold as a means of transport.
I see dialogy farms running up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what we need to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't really feel like I was a nine-minute speaker to get an apple that's not a sub-partalized.
So I started planting a food green in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park park park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I got to my group, the L.A. Green Grus, together, we started planting my food heat, fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're kind of a professional group of pre-connected by all social strata and from all over the city, and it's all voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically gave me a resolution, and said, I need to remove my backyard, the charge plant, to a rusical orientation.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
A popular set of rules for growing food on a piece of land that doesn't matter you?
And I thought, "Cool. Take it with it."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city Council, and I had a member of the top of the world, and I think there was a petition on Change.org, and there were 900 regulations that we were successful.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My town club even called and said they were supporting it and loving what we do.
So, real, why don't they do that?
And L.A. has the largest plains in the United States in the ownership of the city.
They have 67 miles of hardware store.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell shouldn't they find it all right?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, I think, you get a dollar worth of fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my name of my name, I say people to make their own food.
To grow its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I feel like I'm going to be part of that preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
I'm a gardenwork. I'm finding my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, who's shaking the walls, I'm going to add lawns and air plants.
I use the garden, the soil, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my actions for this stuff.
And I'd be surprised to see what the ground is capable of doing if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my backyard become an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the ground.
I'd wonder how children are affected by this.
And we have the cure and the most powerful act of the cure that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can get strawberries.
I remember this time when that mother and her daughter came in, it was like 10 p.m. at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that justified me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum Devil, no, I'm not afraid they're clawing.
And it's on the road.
So that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
Another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in Downtown, L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to get the truck to the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted their mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, maybe even for a moment.
Green Grounds have planted about 20 gardens.
And we got about 50 people in our wake, and they're all volunteers.
If you grow a child, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
If they don't get any of them, if they're not shown, how food and body is influenced, they eat blind, whatever they're admissioned to them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids that are just like the path they're looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
And I think that's a tool we see as an opportunity to train these children to care for their communities to live a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make George Washington Carver the next one.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So that's one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to plant a whole residential block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipscontco and turn it into a healthy cafes.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking for free shit, because free is not sustainable.
The thing about sustainability is you have to keep them through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and having them enjoyment, pride and honorful experience when you build up their own food, and when you open up farmers' markets.
So, what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all ecological rebels, gangsters, gangsta gardeners.
We need to turn the image of the void.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to have to start off with a stutter, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up in a game of greedy chairs and want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some clothes.
If you want to meet me, come with your shuffle, in my backyard, so that we can plant some tracker.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford's English dictionary is "nnollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "It's a "nygoster" means "avolent political."
Although in the 19th century, a new journal of published a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who plays a law enforcement, independent of the party, program or its success, and its success is achieved by the pure power of the monumental scientific ambiguity."
I have no idea what the work is.
I think something about words.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers were not given the exact equivalent word of the debugging.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with an extraordinary name called Brass Crosby, who had a family member of Parliament.
And she threw it in the Tower of London, and he loaded him, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to say, to the end, and he ended up having so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence "so believe in Brass."
Brass Bendem's the English word for a third.
But that's not true. It's a secretary of press freedom.
But to show you how words and policies are tied, I want to take you to the United States, at the time when it just reached independence.
You can think about the question of how to call George Washington, the state of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of an exclusive nation?
and there's been endless debate about this in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible suggestions to do this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Governor Washington, and others, his high-rurity George Washington, and again, the foundation of the freedom of the people in the United States of America.
Not so sure.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought that was safe.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the queue for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored in the room because this debate had three weeks.
I read the diary book of a Senate that's always written: "Take the same topic."
The reason for the delay was, and the bored thing was that the House was against the Senate.
The Kansas House didn't want Washington to be a man who wanted to make him. They didn't want to.
And king, and perhaps they're going to give him ideas for their success.
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most vulnerable, the most distant title they could think of.
This title was "Service."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before, but it just meant that someone was possessed by a meeting.
It's kind of like the predecession of a jury.
He didn't have the same size anymore, when he wrote "The Curve" or "Dearch water."
Sometimes there were little civilized people, and there were government groups, but it was really unmanned title.
So the Senate refused for that,
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy must sign up the agreement and meet foreigners.
Who's going to take it seriously when he has a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, you're not going to use the "diction" in front of you, but they absolutely didn't want to say that they were not right for their unconceived respect for the opinions of the nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, where the state of the state is not necessarily responsible -- and the president is not compelled by the other, and the very unjustable of the nation's own.
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One is -- and I think it's the best -- so I can't figure out if the Senate ever has the name of the national.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just loved the title. He just wait for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- -- wait 223 years later.
And third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States of America today sounds so humorous, right?
That's related to something more than 5,000 nucleic swamps that he has and the largest economy of the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
Truth and story have given the title of size.
And that's how the Senate ended up going.
You've got a respectable title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the head of self-interest -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations there are a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate won, and the representative house lost, because no one feels humbly, if you say you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually the reality changes more, much more than words can ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I went to a truck with about 50 rebellion in fighting the jyalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would sit on my black Conconple half-wire against a pair of brown leatherworms and then I would roll a rocket towards the government-industrial dance that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And I've been a big deal before the war, but besides having Pyjama party and football game games on Samens and he tried to impose graffiti in South-state South-state groups, and interfereational demonstrations that never lived with communism and Afghanistan, and Concording, before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I stand here, I think, a common Afghans, South nations of God Gnaden, an atheist, a radical political artist who's been living in Afghanistan for the last nine years, has been creating and created.
So, there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do art, but I personally don't like to paint rainbows. I want to make art mixed up, that values attract the personality and authority, and it informs the reality and it even uses a kind of creative citizenship to try and figure out the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- wade, which is jihadist against communist, such as "bop-blowing Bling" and used armed religious-hancing and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be done in the jihad-to-fist, as a parliamentary, and to have a choice campaign campaign with the slogan, "Please choose me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to help you to disappoint these mafiosi who are spending as national heroes.
I want to leave the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rearing" where you are a police officer, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, provide money and feeding in the name of Kabul, and hoping that they would take the 100 of us.
I want to think about how the conflict in Afghanistan has become, I think, the traditional conflict.
The war and the strange views that came along with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I created deep-income care with local briquies, or several tosets of local or services in a fashion-specific, in a neochricized world.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan in Kabul looks like Kiplingsell from 1899 to create a dialogue about how today's development-owned individual origins have in the past colonial rhetoric about "The White" to protect the brown man from themselves and maybe even a little bit of civilized.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
And I do it because I have to, because the geography of self is what it demands.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I've been working as a model for a while.
It's been said 10 years since now.
I feel like I was now building in this room a kind of unnamed tension because I didn't want to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I have something else about changing.
This is the first time someone is raising on the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness, I think, to see that.
If there were some women that were really excited when I came out, you don't need to tell me this, I'll read this later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm quite privileged because I can change in very short 10-second seconds of what you think of me.
And that's not the chance everyone has.
These are very uncomfortable, these numbers, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me up, so don't do anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
And that was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture was, I hope.
And if you have a picture of view, it's also a superficial image.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should put my back oil, and with my hand, put it in the hair.
And besides surgeries or false bale that I began to change for work two days ago, there are very few ways to change our utterances, and our utterance is, although it's not just super-trusive -- a huge impact on our lives.
To be fearless, to me, is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a lovely white woman, and in my business, we call this an sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but I'm going to ask you, in the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy, and maybe ask yourself what that legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have no longer defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, in which admiration is wired biologically but also as big, gay and bright.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion reporters from me, "Haltomi. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Li-A."
And first, I'm going to describe your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student from NYU has all been counted on the run-off, each one that's been submitted, and that in 677 simulations, only 27 percent or less than four percent of them don't know.
The next question that's always being asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be anything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which is completely misleading, because you're the first one."
And when they say about this wonderful trade, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "I'm the boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head of American bird genius or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
So to say, you want to be a model later, like, you'd say, you want to win the Jackor in the Lotor.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
I want to give you 10 years of a trained model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer and the light there is exactly where a nice beam is, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a picture going on," now, the leg is first, and long, long, this arm goes back to the back, on the back is three-quarters, and you just move back and you just look back, and you see, you see, you see, your little, 400, 400, 400 times, 400, of your head.
It looks something like this.
I hope that maybe less strange than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's happened.
If you finish school and you have a life cycle and you have a few jobs, you can't say much more, and if you say that you want to be president of the United States, but in your lifetime, you're looking at 10 years of underwear," you're going to be considered strange.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Whoever do you want to collect photos?"
And yes, so much of the photos are retured, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the very first photograph I did, and this was the very first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my period.
I know this is going to be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the launch.
My friend had to come and join me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a launch for French birdry.
This is me with the soccer team and in V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
They're construction, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylist and make-up artists and photographers and Stylistists and all of their assistant assistants and the reprop. They're building. I'm not.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You're doing things for free?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-c-seft gloves I can never carry, except for the things I get free, are things I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a shop, and I had forgotten my money, and I was given the dress for free.
I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she was coming over and she was stopped by a red light, and of course it took a full weight. It just said, "Excuse me, Mr. Winner" -- and we could go on.
I got this costless thing about my appearance, and I didn't have people who are paying a lot of their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped last year, and I was struck, 85 percent black black and Latinos and often young men.
It's only 177,000 young, male and Latino-American, who doesn't ask the question, "Am I stopping?"
And he said, "How often do I stop? When I'm stopped?"
And I found, in my research, that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number goes up to 78 percent when they got 17 percent.
The last question I have to ask myself is, "Well, what is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting that answer: "If you're a little bit thinner and thin hair, then you feel really happy and fab."
And we have a response to backstage that might give that sense.
We say, "It's really great to travel, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of that is true, but it's only half of the story, because we never say before the camera, which I never said before, is, "I feel unsafe."
And I feel unsure because every day I have to think about my appearance.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had little spinnery legs and darker hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most gluteny hair and the most cool flam, and they're probably because of what they look like, probably, most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult for me to move a more honest track, because I felt very uncomfortable to sit here and say, "I got all the benefits from one of the stack that got into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good enough to say, "And that doesn't make me happy."
It was very difficult to reconcile a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the greatest beneficators of it.
But I'm also lucky, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've managed to get here before I've been there, 10 or 30 years since my career is gone, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I paid it, which is so important.
And if you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our strange successes and failures.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother, who had come to life in exile, "Son, leveled Gaddafi's resistance. Let him know.
And I'm never going to be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been almost two years since the Libyan revolution has been inspired by the waves of mass-industrial coverage in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I would join with many other Libyers, and beyond Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gaffadis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, licensed women and men stood in the front row, demanded the end of the regime, held Slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
They have demonstrated some cutting-edge courage by putting on the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity, from far from far from far to far west, all the way to the south.
After a period of six months of cruel war and nearly 50,000 deaths, we managed to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
But Gaddafi did have a huge burden of burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption, and the foundation for the change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regime has destroyed both infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I firmly refer to how many other women re-growing the civil society of Lyyily's disease. We challenged a public and publicly distributed transition to democracy and national equality.
Near 200 organizations, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis, in Benghazi, we have, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops for the issues of capacity, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform of Libyi women, a movement of women, leaders of various different kinds of environments, whose goal is to enter public health-class leadership by the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to be able to face the right as a driver of democracy and peacebuilding.
In the recent elections, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more and more polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and exclusion.
I led an initiative to the peacebuilding platform for women to reach a consistent rule, a law that would vote to every citizen, no matter what background to vote, and to run for, and most importantly, to create a male-to-profit between a male and female in a vertical and horizontal, and to make a vet to a constant score.
and we ended up being informed and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the national meeting in the first election in 52 years.
But long but not long ago, the euphoria of the elections and the whole revolution, after all, we heard about violence every day.
We woke up one morning with the news of ancient mosques and Sufi sons.
Another morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the Embassy.
Then another morning, the wounded were reported by the armed forces of the armed forces.
And indeed, every day under the leadership of the militias and their ongoing values against human rights prisoners, and their misjury of laws and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mental state, polarized, and moved from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice that they had initially.
Type is intolerance, rejection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our discourse and our elections.
And I'm here today to confess that as a nation, we made the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We have misbehared our priorities.
Because the elections did not bring peace or stability and safety in Lybia.
Did the hard box and the change between women and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What's the next thing?
Why is our society going to continue to polarize and dominate the dominance of the dominance and the end of the political, both men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only thing that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gade, and the discomfort.
Our society needs a national dialogue and convergence when it took the elections, which eventually has only empowered polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female as much more than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop talking in the name of anger and demanding a day of revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that does not just honor the values, but also the word "gade rather than revenge, collaboration instead of competition, not an attempt to.
These are the ideals that need you to desperately get peace to the war of war.
Because peace has an alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the cross wiring of feminine and maskal view.
That's the real punching.
And we have to do that in general before we do sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam" -- peace, "is the word of the Good God, Shig."
The word "raveem" again, which is known in all the late-raptical traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rahem" -- "in mother" and symbolizes the female female that surrounds all of humanity, and the female, and the female, all of whom had been run out of all the people.
And just like the mother's mother in the embryo, which is growing in his body, it's so much feeding the basic resiliency of compassion that's ever there.
And so we were told, "My God's going to give all things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has pre-suppers before my penny."
And we all might be denied of the Gemade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with a song called "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we applied the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world out there except America, South Korea and Japan are enemies.
And I often wondered, how is the outside world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until all of this change-changing time.
At the age of seven, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer hungry myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter to a letter from the sister of a colleague.
And she said, "If you were to do this, our five family members will not be here anymore, because we've been eating more.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country laughed.
Shortly after I went out to the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A woman in a pouch was lying on the ground, and a pentged kid in her arm smelled helplessly in her mother's face.
And nobody helped them because they were all busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'999s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Americanans were crying for victims, and many more survived because they ate grass, beetles and telin.
And the rate of electricity has become increasingly common in the night, so that it would all be worse for me to go night, except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag that we've been living in.
I always wondered why they had lights and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amsk, which is part of North Korea as a border between China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vested and enabled North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that, as I was sent to the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China to the relatives.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a very short time.
I never would have thought it would take us 14 years to work again.
It was very hard in China than having a young girl without family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a North Korean refugee. But I soon learned that it wasn't just extreme, it's also very dangerous, but because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
And one day, I became the biggest nightmare ever, when I got caught up in the police department and got to the police officer.
Somebody accused me to be Northernians, so they tested my Chinese names and they made a lot of questions.
I was so scared, I thought my heart would explode.
And if anything unnatural appeared, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made it my feelings of control, and I answered the questions.
And after they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "That was a misguided.
She's not a Northorean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
In fact, some North Koreans in China were testing for foreign messages like Ayl, but many of them are caught by Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released because of tremendous international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have as much happiness.
Every year, there are countless and many colonies of North Korea being caught and they're reported to North Korea, where they're tortured, locked up or executed in publicly.
Even though I was lucky in my dream, many other North Koreans don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
and after they learn a new language and they found work, their world can be put on their head in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was a big challenge in Southern Korea, when I was thinking about it.
English was so important in South Korea, and I had to start my third language.
I also have seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've become very divergent from this, because of 67 years.
I went through a identity crisis.
Am I southern or North-Canadian?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation on my South Korean life did not fall easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the testnaire at university.
And just as I became a normal call from my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean government started taking the money that I was sending to my family, and as a punishment, my family forced to relinate to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started planning for their flight.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to the free.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, ironically I took a flight back to China, and made me go out to the north pole border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles across China, and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got nearly several times caught.
Once, when the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the specation of everybody, and started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I decided to go, and told him that they were more agile, and I was their bosses.
He looked at me very suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get to the Portuguese border, but I had to almost raise my money to register the boundary control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the line, my family was imprisoned because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and cashpay, my family had been released in a month of faked, but only after that, my family was reunited again in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the greatest tremings of my life.
I've done everything I could to protect my family for freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the south-motheran embassy.
I went and went to the intergressive Board and the police station, and I tried to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back to cash or cash money.
I lost all my hope.
And the voice of a man asked me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a foreign person is going to care about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without hesitation, he went to a benchrant, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about all the heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
I'm going to help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The former outsient strangers, for me, symbolized a new hope that required North Koreans so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I, again, united in southern Korea, but the freedom is just one step.
North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, the learning, the professional education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family support, and we're sending them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make hopeful North Koreans success with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi's 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't.
Remi knows what love is.
He's giving them misconditional, and he's giving them a little bit of indifferent.
It's not greedy. He's not on the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just ask yourself, "He never told a lie."
When he sing songs from our childhood, when he tries to speak up to words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown needs to be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He's got absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate fries, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while the very first result of the Teletoon was to put on my arm and have Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't listen to it, really?
A lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they often have been relying on and wrong.
But what motivated my heart and my soul empowered was that although that was the case, even though it wasn't as commonplace, that only one could mean, that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "authorism," it's a complex dysfunction of the brain that's influenced social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's different than this, and it's different in every individual, so Remi is so different from Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes is identified by a new person of autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing emerging communications in the world, there's no known cause of healing or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been faced autism, but I can't remember it every day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very angry.
He didn't want to play the other babies doing, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me.
Remi lived and set up in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy on the tiniest things, like, cars in a row of space, to fit the washing machine and eat everything that was coming out of him.
And as I got older, it became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the ramifications and the deficiency and the never-ending hyperactivity was something that was unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any bias, a human who never had ever been lied.
That's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normalality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not supposed to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each one of us has a gift. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance for size, progress and change dies in the moment we try to be somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Doc Edgerton has been enjoying us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph, through a project of an apple and a unit of radiation from a single millionth.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new imaging technology, which is so fast that it can create slow-time-grained images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are beyond our perspective, looking down at corners, or without an <unk>-ray image in our bodies, and really ask questions about what we mean with "Mamera".
Now, if I take a laser pointer and turn it into a <unk>16th of a second -- these are several parts of the second -- I make a package of photons that's hardly big, and this photon dishonule, this project, will move at the speed of light, and, as I said, a million times faster than a normal project.
So, if you take this project of this, this photons pack, and you put it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into that bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event --
So, think about it, the whole event actually takes less than a nanoscope -- so long enough to take the light back, but I'm going to try to slow this video by the factor of 10 billion to see the light in the motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, is in the bottle with a photon dish, which starts to move through it, and that eventually breaks in.
And part of the light, right out on the table, and you see that spread of waves.
and many of the photons eventually reach the shell and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's streaming around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection is focused on the tail after some images.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back and take the same route again, and we slow that video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know, how long do you have to sit here to see the film?
Day one day? No, one year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal projectile in motion.
And what about something still-life photographer?
You can see again, these waves of the table, which is tracking Tom's, and flattening the wall in the background.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature of the picture was a photo, and it was a Femto image, but of course our eye looks a little bit of a puzzle.
But if you look at these Toms again, you'll see that when the lights are over, the leaks of the tweets, they're going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom got it all the way back in and the light is going to be released after a few and a half seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it might be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if there's a fruit, without touching it at all.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of a little bit of air time, you have very little light, but we make a billion times faster than the shortest air age, so you get as much no light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon pack, which is a million times, and we're drawing this over again with very clever synchrony synchrony, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make this fing video that I just showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do some really interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make things invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superherue: seeing corners?
And the idea is that we're going to light on the door.
It's going to be interrupted, it's going to go into the room, some of that will be reflected back on the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could exploit that more and more of the spacing of the light.
And that's not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left side you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is a soup hidden, and we're going to leave the lights off on the door.
After our paper was published in theNature Communications department, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created these animation.
We're going to put this light project and we're going to put it back on this wall, and this photons pack will be all coneted into all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup, which will then let the light break, and then again, again, reflect the door of a tiny fraction of light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but it will be very interesting in a very different period.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It's got a very good time-solving, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of the distance is.
By making a laser light, we can take a raw image that -- as you can see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we can record many of these images, dozens of these images, and we can try to analyze the different types of light, then we can see that hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got some more to do, before we can put that into the lab and we can build cars that can avoid collisions, and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous deaths, by looking at light, by looking at the open windows, or we can build finalos that can see in the deep waters around the Ok slopes and also look around the bars.
But of course, because of the blind and tissue, that's very challenging, why this is really a wake-up call for scientists, is now thinking about Femto-M photographer, because a new visual imaging tool could actually solve the next generation of medical research problems.
So, like in Docton, even a scientist, a science has become an art of ultra-fight photography, and I realized that all this gigabytes of data we're collecting every single time we use, and we can also create a new form of a computer photographer with a light array, and we can't just look at that wave between every single time.
But here's what happens. It's also a funny thing.
And if you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're going to almost record in light speed, we've got strange effects, and Einstein would have loved this picture incredibly.
The sequence of what's happening in the world is going to appear in a linear sequence, so you can use the relationship of space and time to correct that bias.
So, whether it's photography around corners, or building a new imaging tool for medicine or new approaches to map, since we've been able to open all of the data and detail on our website, and hope that the "compensators" and the innovative community will tell us that we should stop ourselves, we should stop ourselves on the megowars, to start to model, and start to be open on the next dimension.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't meet every neighbor in the street, so many ideas are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors, using things like stickers and scanners and circles.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without worrying for each other?
How can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the home-to-loved houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being reassured by the huge eel, who have been loved, drunkers, and foam, and foam, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone ever ever ever ever sees, New Orleans, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most abandoned parts of America.
I live near this house and I thought, "How can I get it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me, and suddenly her death came, and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I feel a great gratitude for my life, and it brought me a lot of clarity about the things that mattered to me in life.
But I'm a hard time to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a side of the abandoned house into a huge board, and I wrote a bridge of the gaps, "Only I die, I want to die," everyone who can come, can take a piece of chalk, think about their lives and share their hopes in this place.
I wasn't sure what I was going to expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely crowded, and it grew and grew.
I want to share some sentences with you, which were written by the people on the wall.
"I wish I die, I'd like to be sued for piracy."
"I wish I die, I want to stand a full-sized over the International Crisis line."
"I wish I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'd die." I want to plant a tree."
"I wish I die," I want to live subconscious."
"I wish I die." I want to keep them once in my arms."
"I wish I'd die. I want to be a chapcillery."
"I wish I die, I want to be myself."
It was neglected in a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to tears, to wine, and to be ashamed during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and obvious way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages that were dedicated to people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction kit, and now became a world in countries like Kazhstan, South Africa, Australia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to rise and share our voices with others.
And the two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships with other people.
And in a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often held up by talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that makes us most powerful.
The idea of death makes us feel alive.
Our common places are the best important to us as individuals and as community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people can not just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in effective mathematics. I think a special problem for anyone who's been involved in disgusted mathematics is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try and tell you what I'm doing.
Now dancing is one of the most human activity.
We are excited about the fact that we have a lot of super-winning ballet and traders, as you're going to see in a moment.
And you have an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and maybe a fundamental repository that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's are slowly destroying these extraordinary ability, which also makes it my pre-downed Janval League, which at the time was a ballet's still persistent.
Over the years, we've been making a lot of progress in the treatment.
But still, there are 6.3 million people around the world who are suffering from this disease, and they need to live with the indigable symptom like weaknesses, lobster, swings, and more things that are causing that disease, so we need objective tools to find the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether or not there is cure when we have an objective metric that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there are no biomarkors of Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's there is about this 20-minute test on the neurologists.
You have to do it in the clinic. It's very expensive, and that means, outside clinical trials, it's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would make a worthy tour on the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have a expensive hospital worker.
It's 300 percent, by the way, in the neurological unit.
And so I want to propose to you a unconventional method that we're trying to achieve, because we're all, at least, at least, virtual auction like I met Janvalrres.
And you can see a video of the vibrating vocal tapes.
That's what happens in the common state when someone's voice-reading, we can look at the coherent ballet dancers, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we create sounds, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2.
And you need a lot of practice like ballet.
Think about how long a child it takes to learn to speak.
By the way we can translate the position of vibrating vocal commands, and just like the limb is also affected by the mood of Parkinson's disease.
On the lower record, you can see an example of the irregular vocal evidence of the compass.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Bad-read, weakness, jeality.
The language is even more gentle and weakened over time, and that's an example of the number of symbols for it.
So this effect of the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision analysis, combined with new machine-based learning that's now advanced, we can now find exactly where someone's got a disease and health, just because of the sounds of the machine.
So how can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test is in the neurologists.
Very little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both are accurate. And for that, the real question isn't done by experts.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very quick, very much the maximum of 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're extremely cheap, you can also use it in a big amount.
And these amazing goals can be achieved with this.
We can reduce logistics problems for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data by shared observation.
We can do low-cost breeding for clinical trials, and we can do it for the first time for the entire population to be able to do it.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
And we're going to take the first step in this direction, and we're going to start the Parkinson's-Ritational.
With Aulab and patient's cameras, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data for the potential of these goals.
We have a quadruple that is accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can call for a few cents to pass, and I'll say, with joy, we've already gotten six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, say, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
So what's happened is that the patient has to be told during the phone call, whether this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not, OK.
Some of them won't get to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in many different circumstances, which is interesting. Those conditions matter, because we're wired to find out what are the actual markers for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is correct.
It's much better.
My students, Thanasis -- I have to give him a little bit of credit because he's done such fantastic work -- has now shown that it works on the cellular network, which is enabling this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call that an improvement.
That is, people can call the phone, and they can call the test. People could call with Parkinson's, they can call their voice, so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You can see in the background, my father's cows and behind that is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only packed in the south, which means that wildlife are able to leave the park any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed in the night. I woke up in the morning, and I found it dead. It was horrible. It was our only Buock.
My tribe, the southern part of the Masai, believes that we were coming together with our animals and our wildlife around the sky, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I learned lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our tred. They are also responsible for this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are just so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
I have a boy in my tribe who is between six and nine years old, responsible for his father. That's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lionbees fear fire.
But then I realized that wouldn't really help us, but it's helping the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on going.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a birdcard.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird look at it again. And the next time, they come, and they say, this thing doesn't move, it's still there.
and they reach and kill our livestock.
And one night, I would stop the stil. I would walk in the hand with a torch around him, and this time the lions didn't catch.
And the reason is that lions fear light, it moves.
I had an idea.
I was working in my room as a little boy, and I even took the new radio back to my mother, and the day it almost took me around electronics. But I learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a power station from a motorcycle, and that shows that if you want to turn right or left, it blinks.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little pel that's made from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built all of these things together.
The Solarpan invites the battery, which provides the electricity to the power-panger. I call it a transformer.
And the Internet noise is blinked.
You can see that the levers are going to be outwards, because of where the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are bright and the lions believe I'm going around the stairs. I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our home, and since then, we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I've installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they work really well.
Now, my idea is now used in Kenya, including for other predators like hyenums or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to a grant at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helps fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights in together where there's no one, and I'm showing people how to use them.
One year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna who was eating his father's cows, and I looked at airplanes about me, and I said, "Well, I'm going to sit in one of them."
And here I am.
I was invited to do an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to listen. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and we can share the lions together, side by side with lions, without any argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language that means, "I appreciate you.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yeah.
You work on other electric inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electric fence. An electroconce fence?
Yeah, I know that electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, right -- Yeah, I tried it a little bit, but I've given the try again because I got a blow.
All the time, it's hard. Richard Turer, you're kind of special.
We're going to hire you every step of your walk, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but I'm going to share with you today 15 of my favorites; and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of executive, no style, no chance of even shoot a picture, not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random, documentary tourists.
My story starts as a talk in New York, and my wife took this picture, where I hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57 and 5s.
And just a year later, we were back in New York, so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going on --
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you go to New York City and do a father's daughter's Day tour, and you're going to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking for a new tourist to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a complete stranger, you can get his camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever told with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these trips would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just a week that was taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened that the day so a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a given moment, or a certain journey.
It's also a way for us to take a week in October, to stop time and change our time and how we are going to live year-round, not just physically but in everything.
Although we always make the same picture, our perspective of time is changing as they get to more and more new milestone, I can see life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and what it sees.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value, and expect for every year.
Well, recently, as one of our trips were walking, and all of a sudden we were walking together, and suddenly they were being turned out to be a red tracker on a dollset, which they had learned as a little kid, at the previous age of travel.
And she told me about her feelings, which she thought was five years old, at this point.
She said she remembered her heart of her chest when she first saw the store nine years ago.
And now they look up in New York, and they look up in high school schools, because they really want to go to school in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we're all creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking active role in conscious memories.
I don't know about you, but besides those 15 images, I'm hardly nearly a family photo.
I'm always the one who makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image and not ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 26.07, 56.3/33.1/21.0/13.4 (BP=0.969, ration=0.969)
