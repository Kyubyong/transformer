When I was 11 years old, I was in the eavesdrop of the sounds of the songs.
My father listened to his little, gray radio on the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy at what was rather unusual at the time, because he was most depressed by the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my dad made me very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban were pouring the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
And so for five years, I was embarrassed as a boy, and I was left by my older sister who was no longer allowed to go alone to a secret school.
It's the only way we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different way, so that we could not guess where we went.
We just put our books in shopping bags so it looks like we're just going to buy.
We're in a house where we're made over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of neat, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and every time, all the classes had to drop out for a week, because the Taliban had evaporated.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to demand us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family where education was important and valued for daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
One of the outsider from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted that his daughter -- my mother -- was to go to school and was distracted by his father.
My mother grew up, but she became a teacher.
That's her.
She was the retirement age two years ago just to make our house a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my dad -- here's the first one in his family that ever received education.
For him, it was always clear that his children were going to get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of sending his children to school.
I remember that in the years, I was sometimes so frustrated by the Taliban, by the time we live, by the constant fear and the perspective of immotion.
I was very good to abandon, but my dad said, "Ton-daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing is going to always remain, which is what's in here. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So, you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old now.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women of my age have had a higher degree than the Sekar degree, and if my family hadn't used so much for my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I stand here today, as a proudly Palestinian of the Middle School College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was released from his family, because he missed to send his daughters to school, one of the first was congratulating.
He doesn't just let me graduate school, but also that I was the first woman and I was driving through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even greater dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start the idea of going on SOLA, and maybe the only intern of girls in Afghanistan, a country where school school is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to take their own great aspirations to all of them.
And to see their parents and fathers stand for them, and as my parents were at the time, despite all odds, were against all odds.
As Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is one of my students' father.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and they're through a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone rang, and a voice driver would block him if he was sent to school, she would try again.
And he said, "Look, if you want me, I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game for your old-trenching and over-reviewed imagination."
In Afghanistan, as I've discovered, something that is often defending in the West: the one of our most succeed, is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and is aware that their success is also success.
I don't mean our mothers don't want to play an important role in our success.
They're often the ones that are more likely to rise and compelling and compelling future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, men's support is essential.
The Taliban just went a few hundred girls to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls do not press the school bank.
Afghanistan appears like America is like this.
Americans will recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the length and the intermediated groups of the U.S. have changed.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school, and their parents who are using them, who are encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unlimited possibility, and remember the girl every day, going to the SOLA.
It's the way I have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as a profession -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
1971 to 1971 -- I look very young, but I'm not -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on the engineering projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and I failed every single project we put on the legs.
I was desperate.
I mean, 21 years ago, we thought we're good at Italy and we're doing good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were looking at.
Our first project, which inspired my first book in Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias how to grow food.
We went to the local Italian seed in South Zambia, and this lovely valley that leads to Sambesi River. We taught the local citizens of the Italian tomato and Tchini and ...
And of course, the local people had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to do it, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such a fertile valley that was in there.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank goodness we're here!"
"Mave it on time to save the people of Sambias before the star."
Of course, everything's wonderful in Africa.
We had these ferry tomatoes. In Italy, they got so big, they were so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the Sambults, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato was coming up and red, about 200 bites of fish were coming out of the river and around.
We said to the Sambennas, "Oh my God, the nodter!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so enthusiastic in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French did, and after I saw what they did, I was proud of our project in Zambia.
We at least fed the cottonse.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've not given to the existing African.
They should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, who is a joint economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given a trillion dollars of the African continent in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what that money did.
Just read your book.
Think about a African woman what we did.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we patron them, or we are patriarchists.
Both words come from the Latin root, which means "fater,"
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm treating every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "breatwana, head.
I was gagged when I read the book "Small Beautiful" of Schder, and he said, especially in the economic development, if people don't want help, they will leave you alone.
That should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and he asked, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolonized?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just respond to people, and I created a system called the corporate development that never was initiated, never gets motivated, but you become the service of local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you sit down with the local community.
We don't work from office.
We meet in cafeteria. We meet in kelages.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to close with a friend's work and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like what you're doing?
The passion for your own growth is the most important thing.
The passion for your own life is the most important thing in human history.
We're helping them find knowledge because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one trap: Why not when I came to a community and say to people what they should do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Entrepreneurs never have a part of it, and they'll never say in public terms of what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Let's design this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working on one to do that, we have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital of the company who's sitting in your house, at your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the resources, your passion, in a way, to transform life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was a doctor who was now, and I was trying to escape the disengage, where we say to others what to do.
And so I walked through the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, I helped him. He was a fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then go, and the fishermen came, and said, "You helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers, and I was working together and I didn't sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents perqo, but I was working for the Japanese for 15 dollars sushi on sushi, and then the farmers came up to me and said, "Hey, you helped them? Can you help us?"
I went on 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I'm holding my mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- -- So the government says, "Let's try again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies who are going to go on and out of loneliness.
And Peter's printer, one of the best CEO of history, died over 96 years ago.
So Peter's Professor, who was working on business before he was working with a company. Peter's a printer, he said, design is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Buildability is the death carn of entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get you to get to one.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get out of there.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What are the most applaudy you guys doing this morning?
"Sear, passionate people. You applaud this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- nameless fossil fuels, manufacturing, and all of a sudden there are systems that are unsustainable.
The burn machine is unsustainable.
The open-source species of preservation is unsustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, create and interlocking them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it.
Government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to talk about the future of the city in New York in 180.
In 1860, they came together and they were speculated, which would happen in the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows on this speed, they needed six million horses to get people to do it, and it was impossible to get them done with six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
1860s, they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the U.S. -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were tiny little factories in the backlands.
And Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing you need to do is to be offered discontion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of them have to do is do three things: to sell a product, to be grand, to be grand, to be grand.
What do you think?
We never met a single person who can make something, and then sell and care for that.
That's not true of the way that we do.
This person was never born.
We've done research and looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been put together, except one thing: None of one person was founded.
Now we teach 16 year-old entrepreneurs in Northland, and we start teaching them to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransith Autographics, and the task of 16 year-old students is to help the people of Richard Bransonsop Imscreen, how often he uses the word "h" and how often we call the word "we."
Never "ich" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where a group of developers who are sitting in cafeteria, in cafeteria and Bars. They're the committed buddy that they're going to do for them, what someone of this gentleman who talks about this epology is talking to you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." I'd like you to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate advocacy to help them find the means and people. We've found that the miracle of the intelligence of the local population is that the culture and the economy of this community can be transformed only by the one that is the passion, the energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should have to be Alice in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to try to encourage engineers to communicate in communication.
I was scared.
I mean, really fear. I mean, before these students with their large brains and their large books and their large books, I don't trust my own words.
But when the conversation came along, it was like Alice, when she was pumping down to the canon, and a door was looking to a whole new world.
And I also felt when I was talking to the students, and I was amazed at the idea that they had and I wanted others to discover this miracle country.
I think that we need to open up this door, it needs great communication.
We need to really bring great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go. I think that it's in our responsibility as a non-scientist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, let's go for a little.
I want to show you a few ways that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing is busy, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is: Okay, and what?
Let's tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that their grazing is also telling us that their grazing, the handheld structure in our bones, is studied in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat ooposis.
And if you describe what you do, you will be preventing subject.
Now, the subject is a obstacle to your mind.
I mean, surely you could use your "lit and time-to-time," but why doesn't you just say "space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
To make our ideas understand is not the same as pushing off your level.
As Einstein was saying earlier, "Make things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can tell us something about your scientific area without having to deal with tradeoffs.
So a few things are about, examples of stories and analogies. So that's how you can pull us into your closet.
And if you present your work, let's go away the positions.
Have you ever asked why it's called "front point?"
What happens when someone stands? Another one is going to be cut, and those dots are the first ones that your audience is.
Now, a slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the talk-based part of the brain, and that's how we're very quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more effective, and it shows that the specific structure of the graft is so robust that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffviem Tower.
The trick here is to use an individual, simple, read-and-draw-the-face sentence that the audience can, once it loses the thread, use images and graphs that also make our other senses a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up those towers and see the wonderland that science and technology has come in.
because the engineers I've taught have taught me to put in the Nerdleard with me, I want to sum it up with an equation.
Look at your science numbers and your dictionary, they share it through the relevance, so the audience says what's important, and they multiply the whole thing you've had for your incredible work, and it's a continual interaction that is full of new ideas.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was very concerned about it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can shoot a crime in Syria with a cell phone.
You can tweet a phone, and launch a report in Egypt.
And you can take a videoboard and you can record a song, get it up on the soundCloud and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this town.
And you can see there, like hundreds of thousands of people went on the street and demonstrated.
We are in the fall of 1989, and imagine that all these people who were coming in and asking changes, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up.
Keep it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot of them. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about myself and my cell phone and how my life changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Pump data.
And why are the information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. mission has launched a rule line.
This is a policy line called the U.S. supply chain.
So the rule that we call the telecom company in Europe, every Internet service provider in Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who calls an email?
Who gets a text message from who's going to get it?
And when you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet service.
And all over Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to supply this farm shelter.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet service to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see that tens of thousands of people were wandering around the streets of Berlin and saying, "Freever instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be on the stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the stealth apocizei of Eastern Germany.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Deutsche Telecom, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information you've stored on me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. It was just a clean Bla Bla.
But then I told myself that I want to have this information because it's my life that is tracking it.
So I decided to put a trial against it, because I wanted to get this information.
But the German Telegraph said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to pull back the rule that they were asking me to send all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court determined that the introduction of the E.U. line was a German law enforcement mark.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD, this is what it was.
35 in830 lines of information.
I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with it?
Because you can see where I'm, where I'm asleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them out.
Because I want to show people what the farm protection system means.
So over time, online and open data town, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, track it.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt to the train to C<unk>nn, and how many calls I'm making.
All of this is possible through this information.
That makes you a little scared.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I call my wife up, and she calls me, and we'll talk a few times.
And then a few friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you, and we have this huge network of communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see anything.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who's talking to who you're talking to who you're talking to who you're talking to, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months, in Europe, to 2 years.
As I said at the beginning, let's imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins had cell phones in their bag in 1989,
And the Stasi had known who was doing this, and if the Stasi had known who the leader was, that would probably never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And even after that, the fall of the iron curtain.
Because today, the state agency and companies want to store so many information that they can get about us, online and online.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all over a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and that's not an old-fashioned one.
When you go home, you say your bosses, just because companies and state countries have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: curbs, rapid restaurants, brid spaces.
So the city planner comes together and they decided to change the name of South Central America, so that it was for something else, it changed in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's going on wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Silder stores, rapid restaurants, bricks.
So, like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivethrus and the Drivebys.
The comedy is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles for disinfectable diseases.
For example, obesity in my neighborhood is five times higher than Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really appreciate that.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food if you go out of the house, you see the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I've taken the chairs and I'm sold as a means of transport.
I see dialogy towers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that we have to stop that.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't really feel like I was a 9<unk>3-year-old fellow to get an apple that's not under-spaced with pesticides.
So I put a food drum in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a parking lot.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to nurture it.
So I think "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grus, and we started planting my food drum and fruit trees, the whole program, vegetables.
We're kind of a pre-material group, put together by the gardeners of all the social layers and from the entire city, it's completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically gave me a resolution, and he said I needed to remove my backyard, which was a legal orientation.
And I thought, "Yeah, come on, right?
A popular set of mandates for growing food on a piece of land that doesn't matter to you?
And I thought, "Cool. Her Tives with it."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city Council, and with a member of Green, and they submitted a petition to Change.org, and with 900 Signatures, we succeeded.
We held the victory in the hands.
My city council even called and said they were supporting it and loving what we do.
So, real, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest bricks in the United States in the property of the city.
They have 4,200 miles in the hardware room.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell shouldn't you find that right?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, I think, it's a dollar worth of money, and I'm given vegetables and vegetables that are 75 dollars.
It's my name of mine, I say people to make their own food.
To make its own food grow, it's like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of this preconceptive reality that was made by other people, and I made my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
So gardenwork is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who is shaking the walls, I swear my lawn and air plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my use for this stuff.
You'd be surprised what the ground can do anything that you use when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touched people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my backyard become an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We're the ground.
I'd wonder how children are affected by that.
And gardening is the most therapeutic and the most audacious act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can get strawberries.
I remember that time when this mother and her daughter came in, it was about 10:3 o'. They were in my backyard, and I came out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just made me feel empowered to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you don't worry about being thrown out of your food."
And I said, "Zum Devil, no, I'm not afraid that they're stealing.
And it's the street, though.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take care of their health."
Another time, I put a garden in the homeless house in Downtown.A.
These are the guys who helped me to kick the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted their mom and their grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even if it was just for a moment.
Green Grains have planted about 20 gardens.
And we got about 50 people, and we got there, and they're all volunteers.
When children grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
If they don't get any of them if they're not shown, how food and body affects them, they eat blindly whatever you're putting them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path they were looking for, and they don't get anywhere.
The gardening and the opportunity we see as an opportunity to train these children to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make George Washington Carver the next one.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole resident of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipscontard and turn it into healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The comedy about sustainability is that you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and having them enjoy the joy of honor and honor when you build up their own food, and when you open farmers.
So, what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all ecological rebels, gangsters, gangmen and shard gardeners.
We have to turn the image of the vague.
If you're not a brush, you're not a gangman.
You know, how do you start to go with a carpenter?
Let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up if you want to sit in jets and make a meeting where you talk about doing some clothes.
If you want to meet me, you come to your celest, in my backyard, so that we could plant some tracker.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nnollygoll."
Because it sounds so nice, because it sounds so nice.
And "nnon Hagoster" means "a-free political."
And although a newspaper publisher took a better definition, "One Snollyg Monde is someone who orders a riot, independent of the party, program or its success, and his success is achieved by the pure power of the monumental scientific declaration."
I have no idea what the restorade is.
Something that I think I think about.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
So 1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers were not allowed to reveal the exact same word of debugging.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with an extraordinary name called Brass Crosby, who had moved to parliament.
And they took him to the Tower of London and they urged him, but he was brave enough, he was bold enough to go, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so believe in brass."
Brass Brass Bends the English word for the tin.
But that's not true. It's a secretary of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to America at the time when it just reached independence.
And you've been looking at the question of, what would you call George Washington, the state of state?
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader a Republican nation?
and there's been an awful lot of controversy in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible suggestions to do this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Governor Washington, and others, his high-rurity George Washington, and again, protectuary of the freedom of the people of the United States of America.
Not that much like that.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was approved.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored in a little bit because it had three weeks of the conversation.
I read the journal of a Senate that was always writing, "Take the same topic."
The reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House was against the Senate.
The Kansas House didn't want Washington to be a koyier. They didn't want to.
The king would call it, and maybe it could make it into ideas for its success.
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most dowest, the most distant title that they could think of.
This was "The Talksterist."
President. They didn't invent the title. He just thought that someone was pre-connected.
It's something like the predecession of a jury.
It had no longer the size of the performance or the "dunry."
Sometimes there were little colonial people and government groups, but it was really unmanned title.
So the Senate refused to go.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy must sign up the treaty and meet foreign-eds.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And even after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, you've been asked to use the cover, but they absolutely didn't want to make sure they were not willing to do it because of their own respect for the opinions and civilized nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, where it's the state of the state of unjusted -- not worthy of the president -- and that the president of the United Nations is not the deal.
You can learn about three interesting things.
One is -- and this is the best thing I can find -- until now, I can't figure out whether the Senate has ever called the national president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, she just called the title. He just wait for the Senate to be active.
The second thing you can learn is that when a government says something temporary -- -- wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is that the most important point is that the title of the United States today is not so humorous, right?
That's related to something over 5,000 nucleic lobbs that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drone and all that stuff.
Because the story and story have given the title.
And that's how the Senate ended up winning.
You've got a respectable title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the sounds of self-interest -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations do you know that a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, and the Kansas House lost its audition, because no one feels humbling when you say that you're the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can carry with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually the reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I went to a truck with about 50 rebellion to the battle of Ukraine -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would sit on my black Conconpoel to a pair of brown leatherymale and I would roll a rocket towards the government war that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been a big deal since I went to war, but next to Pyjama and football parties, and he was struggling with plumbing South countries and interfere with irrational demonstrations that never lived with communism and Afghanistan and Convention before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I stand here today, I think Afghans, South nations of God Gnaden, an atheist, and a radical political artist who's been working in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So there are many great things that you could do in Afghanistan, but I personally don't like painting rainworms. I want to make art that will bring out and challenge the personality and reputations and the reality and even using a kind of imaginative community to try and understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- wagagging that meant jihad against communists like <unk>Sopbling<unk>, and use armed religious disarmment and political corruption to enrich itself.
And what else can do jihad-first-the-dist, as for the parliament, and to do a choice campaign with the slogan, "Please do me jihad! And I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi who are spending as national heroes.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rurning," where you're a police officer, build a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes from them, supply money, and devise the names of Kabul on them, and hope that they will take 100 percent of us from Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the traditional conflict.
The war and the awkward views that came along with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I created the fur from local Afghan dressers to a protective compound or even multiple indoor equipment into a neo-realized art process.
And I'd like to see how a simple fan from Kabul looks like Kipling Appell in 1899 to create a dialogue that the current development organizations have its roots in the past colonial rhetoric about "The White Leach of Man" to protect the man from behind the brown man and maybe even a little bit of civic.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
But I'm doing it because I have to, because the geography of self is what it demands.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and I've been working as a model for a while.
It's been around 10 years ago, exactly.
I feel like I've built a very unquenced tension here in the room, because I shouldn't wear that dress.
Fortunately, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is raising at the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness that you can see.
If a few women were really shooking when I came out, you don't need to tell me that I was reading it later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged because I can change what you think of me in very short 10-second seconds.
And it's not the chance that everybody has.
These tracks are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because you're all going to wake me off, so you don't do anything until it's above my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not an obvious way to do this.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should put my back oil and put my hand on the hair of this guy.
And apart from surgeries or false grazing, which I was doing two days ago, there's very few ways to change our utterance, and our utterance is -- although it's super-simport and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Now, fear is fearless to me, to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I stand on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this an sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but I'm going to ask them to be honest.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and you might ask yourself what that legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we've been defined not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, but of course we're programmed biologically but also as big, oppressor and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion agentes come up, "Haltomi. Naomi, Tyra Smel. Li Wen."
And first of all, I'm going to comment on your model. Very impressive.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, there was a very ambitious Ph.D. student that's always counted all the modules on the runway, each of which was being arrested, and that at 677 parts were not only 6 or four percent.
The next question that's always asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which is completely misleading, because if you were the first one."
And when they say about this great countershell, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who the driver."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head editor of American aviation or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say you're going to want to be a model later, like you're going to say you want to win the Jackor in the lottery.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
So I want to show you 10 years of a newborn model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgeons, it can only be unfolding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice radiation, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a picture going on," well, the leg goes up first, beautiful and long, long, this arm, back to the back, is on the head on the side of three and just move back and forth and you see, and then you want to see, you can see, your own, 400, 400, 400 years ago.
It looks something like this.
I hope that it's less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and have made a life and a few jobs, unfortunately you can't say much more. If you want to be president of the United States, but in the course of life, "10 years of underwear," you will look at weirdness.
The next question that's been asked to me is, "Who are you going to revive all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much all of the photos will be retooled, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photograph I did, and it was also the first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have that period.
I know it's going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is how I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the launch.
My friend had to get involved.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a bait for French birdry.
This is me with the soccer team and in V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
They're construction, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and make-up artists and photographers and Stylists and all of their assistants and the reprostitution. They're not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You are doing things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot-cuffers I can never wear except for the things I get free, things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I lost my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a horrible driver, and she was going to go through a red light light, and of course it was stopped. It just took one: "Excuse me, Mr. Wagmeister," and we could go on.
I got this free stuff about my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who are paying for their appearance and not because of their personality, they pay a high price.
I live in New York and the 140 teenagers who have been stopped last year and shot over, 85 percent black and Latinos and mostly young men.
It's only 177 young black black and Latino young, where it's not asking the question, "Am I stopping?"
It was, "How many times do I get stopped? When am I stopped?"
In my research to this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent when it got 17 percent.
The last question about me is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they expect that answer, "If you're a little bit thinner and a shiny hair, then you feel very happy and fab."
And we give backstage an answer that might give that sense.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's just half of the story, because we never say before the camera I've ever said before, it's "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure, because every day I have to think about what my appearance is.
And if you ever ask, "Would I be happier if I had thin legs and shiny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the thin legs and the most gloomy hair and the most cool stuff they're, and they're probably the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to move a more honest journey, because I felt very uncomfortable to go here and say, "I got all the benefits from one of the stack that was being put into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good for me to rearrange, and that's not always going to make me happy."
It was very difficult to put a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the largest beneficiaries of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that before I got here, 10 or 30 years ago, my career has been more complete, because I wouldn't think I was going to tell my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I paid it, which is so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk and hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misconceptions and failures.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile: "Son, Laddafi's Resistance. Let's get it.
But I'm never going to be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been nearly two years since the Libyan revolution has been inspired by the waves of mass incarceration in both the Tunisian revolution.
I connected myself to many other Libyans, in and outside Slayens, to challenge a day of anger and launch a revolution against the tyrannic regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, licensed women and men stood in the front row, asking the end of the regime, held Slogans's freedom, dignity and social justice into the air.
They've demonstrated some cutting-edge courage by putting Gaddafis against the brutal dictator.
They showed a strong meaning of solidarity, from far from far from far to far west, all the way to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and nearly 50,000 deaths, we managed to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a huge patron of a political legacy, corruption, and the foundation for the change.
Over four decades, Gaddafian regime has destroyed both infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of the ly-bian society.
The devastation and the challenges I, as many women have, I re-evolved to rebuild the civil society of Lybia. We challenged a publicized and unrestrained transition to democracy and national uniformity.
Near 200 organizations, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis, started in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybia, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops to the issues of capacity, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform of Libyi women, a movement of women, leaders from various backgrounds, whose goal is to enter public health reformals for women, and to consider for our right-ranging rights with democracy and peacebuilding.
In the elections, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and its inclusion.
I was awarding an initiative for the peacebuilding collection of women to become a state-public policy, a law that should give any citizen, no matter what context to choose, and to vote for political parties, and especially to set a male party between two and two candidate judges on vertical and vertical-sized level, and to make a vetpilary to make a right.
At the end, we've been replicated and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the national riots in the first election since 52 years.
But slowly, the euphoria of elections, and the whole revolution, because every day we started to get on new messages about violence.
One morning we woke up to the lead of ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
Another morning, we got the message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack.
and then another morning, suicide bombers were signed by the army.
And indeed, every day under the leadership of militias and their ongoing values against human prisoners and their misdiagnosed acts of laws and laws.
Our society, composed by a revolutionary mental state, polarizing and distant from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice that they had initially stopped.
Intent, disconnection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our discourse and our elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, have made the false choice and wrong choices.
We have misjudged our priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the hard-loid and the interplay between women and male candidate peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What's it then?
Why is it that our society will continue to polarize and dominate the dominance of dominance and the end of it, both men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only thing that missed, but the female values of compassion, the Gemade and the end.
Our society needs a national dialogue and convergence when it's taken the elections that ultimately has only increased the polarization and decoration.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of anger and demanding a day of revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gemade.
We need to develop a female discourse that does not only lead values but also to the extent: the revenge rather than the revenge, cooperate instead of competition, instead of an out-of-off.
These are the ideals that need a war to desperately get peace.
Because peace has an alchemy and in this alchemy, it's about the interconnection of feminine and maskal view.
That's the true punching.
And we have to do that in an existential way before we do sociopolitical.
After an out of the Koran, "Salam" -- "is the word of the Good God, Shig."
The word "rawem" again, which is known in all the late-rapt traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rahem" -- "in mother-in-law, symbolizing the homemine that surrounds the whole humanity, of the manhood and the female of all tribes and all the peoples who have gone.
And just like the mother, who grows in the embryo, he's completely free to feed the basic posture of the compassion of the existence.
And so we were told, "My Gade Adves are all doing things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has preigned before my ranch."
Let's be the case that we all get the Gosthe.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world out there except America, South Korea and Japan are enemies.
And while I was often wondering what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until all of this changes in a different way.
At age seven, I saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to never suffer starvation myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter, from the sister of a colleague.
And he said, "If you were listening to this, our five family members will not be in this world, because we've had nothing to eat since two weeks.
We're all together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
Shortly, I went over to the station and saw something horrible that I can't delete anymore from my memory.
A peless woman was lying on the ground, and a pounding kid in her arm was helpless in her mother's face.
And nobody helped them because they were all busy caring for themselves and their families.
The mid-'9s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were enjoying the sacrifice for the killing, and many others survived because they ate grass, beetles and trees.
Offication has become more and more common, so that at night, it was all twisted, except for the lights from China on the other side of the tag that we stayed in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amr, which is part of the road between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very vested and enabled North Koreans to escape.
Many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can tell you that, during the late years of famine, I was sent to China's relatives.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take us 14 years to work together.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a North Korean refugee. But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in an increasingly fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
And one day, I was truly aware of my biggest nightmare when I was caught by the Chinese police department and was sent to the police officer.
Somebody accused me to be Northern Korean, so they took my Chinese names and made a lot of questions.
I was so afraid of this, I thought, I was going to explode my heart.
And if anything unnatural came out, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my feelings and answer the questions.
And after they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "That was a misguided.
She's not a Northstore."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China were getting into foreign messages called Asyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released because of tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have that much happiness.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans being caught in China and they're monitoring North Korea, where they were being tortured, imprisoned or publicly executed.
Even though I was lucky enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
and after they learn a new language and found work, their world can be turned on at a moment.
So after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was leaving South Korea a bigger challenge than I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start my third language.
And I also saw the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of it, we're very diverged, because of 67 years,
I went through a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstore?
Where am I from? Who am I?
And suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't make any difference, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording report at the university.
As I became a normal call from my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean government started taking the money that I was sending to my family, and as a punishment, my family forced me to relocated to a remote location on land.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started planning for escape.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to the freedom of their way.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically I took a flight back to China and made me go to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles through China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got nearly several times.
Once, when the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the specation of everyone, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official called my family, I decided to stand up and told him that they were greens, and I was their bosses.
He looked at me ruthless, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get to the Portuguese border, but I had to use almost all my money to make the boundary with Laos's border.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was imprisoned, because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and cashpay, my family had been released in a month, but it was soon given to my family, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the largest disregurations of my life.
I'd done everything to protect my family for freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went and I went between the immigrant agency and the police department, and I was desperate to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to get back to cash or cashrupt cash.
I lost all my hope.
And the voice of a man was like, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a foreign person is going to care about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without hiring, he went to a bank engine, and they paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him by all my heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The former outsient foreigners for me described a new hope that required North Koreans so desperately, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of international community as the hope that North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I, again, united in South Korea, but the freedom is just one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, job education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family support, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so fortunate to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make hopeful North Koreans success with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi's 22, and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it, and he divides it.
It's not greedy. He doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and he just asks you, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to speak to words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It's got absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate fries, but he remembers the release of every song on my iPod, talking when he was four, while the first episode of the Teletbies on my arm was to put on my arm and Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't listen to it?
A lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they're often overrun and wrong.
But what motivated my heart and strengthen my soul was that although it was the case, even though it was not as common, it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- with autism and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "authorism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that's influenced social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's a different way to make it different than any individual, so Remi is so different from Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes is identified in a new person autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been talking to autism, but I can't remember it every day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He was screaming a lot.
He didn't want to play how the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in being at all.
Remi lived and set up his own world with his own rules, and he found joy on the tiniest things, like cars in a row of room, to attract the washing machine and eat everything that came under him.
And when he got older, he was getting different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the Frustas and the never-ending hyperactivity, something that was really unique: an pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been lied.
That's extraordinary.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normalality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody has a gift in it. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The opportunity to scale, progress and change dies at the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has filled us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph on a project of a apple and a unit of radiation by just a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto Photography, a new imaging technique that's so fast that it can create slow-time-time-time-motion of light.
And so we can build cameras that look out at the outside of our frame or can't look inside an <unk>-ray image in our body and really question what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it in a <unk>1 billionth of a second -- these are several parts of the second -- I'm creating a package of photons that is barely a millimeter wide, and this photon pack, this project, is moving at the speed of light, and, like, a million times faster than a normal project.
So if you take this project, this photons pack and put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, think about it, the whole event actually takes less than a nanosecond -- so long as long as we can go back this track -- but I need to slow this video to get the factor 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola has not financed this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectile, goes into the bottle with a photon dish that starts to move through it and eventually break through it.
And part of the light comes out to the table, and you can see that spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the wheel's tail and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in the bottle that's streaming around.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table and over the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the penis is focused on some images at the end of the bottle.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back and take the same route and slow the video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
Woman: One week? No. One year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little still-life photographer?
You can see again, the waves of the table, the Tom's, and the wall over there.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature of this painting a photo, each of which is a Femto image, but of course our eye looks a collection image.
But if you look at these Toms, you'll see that when the lights are over, the lights are going to be turned over, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is coming up, and the light is floating around it, and after a few billion seconds, it's coming out.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it might be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if there's an fruit, without touching it at all.
So how did my team build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you do a photograph with a short air age, you have very little light, but we're putting a billion times faster than the shortest air age, so you're going to get as fast as light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon pack, and we're drawing this, and we're going to do it again, and again, very clever synchronizing, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make this Femem video that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superstar: can we see corners?
The idea is that we're lighting a light on the door.
It's going to be interrupted, it's going to go into the room, it's part of it, it's going to bounce back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use that more quadruder of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even made it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden a puppet, and we're going to let the light go off the door.
So after our paper was published in the UN Communications Center, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to chop up this light project and we're going to put it back on this wall and this photons package will be allocated into all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then let the light break, and then reflect a part of the broken light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but the most interesting time it will be.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It's got a very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point of distance is.
So by putting a laser on, we can take a raw image that does -- how you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we pick up many of these images, dozens of these images, and we put them together and try and analyze the different light walls, we can see that object that's hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got to do something even before we can implement this in the lab, we could build cars that avoid collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous incidents, by looking at light, by bouncing through open windows, or we can build finaloscopes that see deep around the body, around Ok and Kotho.
But of course, because of the blood and tissue, this is very challenging, and that's why this is really a wake-up call for scientists, is now thinking about Femto-M photographer, because a new imaging tool could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as a matter of Docton, even a scientist, the science has become an art of the ultra-second photography, and I realized that all this terabytes of data we're gathering every time we use, not just a new version of a computer photographer, and a light capture, and we can just look at that wave between that time.
But it's also a funny thing to happen here.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're going to almost record at the speed of light, have some strange effects, and Einstein would have loved this picture.
The sequence of what's happening in the world appears in a more repetitive sequence, so by applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So, don't matter whether it's about photography around, or making a new imaging tool that we need to do for medicine or new forms since we've been able to open all of our data and hope that the "marser" and the innovative community will show us that we should stop to step forward to the megapotary to the next-dimensional and to start the next-dimensional.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't make every neighbor on the street so many teaching disabilities are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to divide more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and scars and crosses.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do you pay to your neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without disturbing each other?
How can we divide our memories from the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is woven by the huge eel that for hundreds of years, possessing crayons and foaming shadows, I trust a city where there is always music.
I think every time someone never ever saw, there's a parade in New Orleans.
This is a city that has some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city that has most abandoned pieces in America.
I live near this house and I thought, how can I get it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother, and her death came on and unexpectedly.
I've spent a lot of thinking about death, and I've felt a great gratitude for my life, and it's given me a lot of clarity about the things that I've been interested in in in life now.
But it's hard for me to keep that view on a daily basis.
It's easy to lose your daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giant billboard and I wrote a scrabble in the gaps: "In the end, I'd die," everyone who walks, can take a piece of chalk, think about their lives and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I was expecting at the experiment, but the next day was completely filled, and it grew and grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I wish I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I wish I die, I want to stand a full-sized over the International Crisis line."
"I wish I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I wish I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I wish I'd die."
"I wish I die. I want to keep it in my arms."
"I wish I die. I want to be a chapavic."
"I wish I die. I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of the people made me laugh, the wine and fading me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and more inclusive way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and remembering what we care about as we grow and change.
I did this last year and I received hundreds of messages that were dedicated to building a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction kit, and now in countries like Kasakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have when we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often held by talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that makes us more powerful.
The idea of death makes us feel.
Our common spaces are the best that we are as individuals and as a community are important, and with more opportunities, to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people around us can not just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm involved in disgusted mathematics. It's a special problem for anyone who's been involved in disgusted mathematics, that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try and tell you what I do.
We know that dancing is one of the most human activity.
We are thrilled by the sight of the Dander Ballet and the roders, as you'll see in the moment.
There's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities that can be predicted by the ballet that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary skill, which also makes it to my wife of Janden Abpling, who was the moment a ballet abys.
Over the years, we've been making a lot of progress in treatment.
And yet, there are 6.3 million people living on this illness, and they have to have to do with the most disastable symptom like weakness, death, taxity and other things that are causing that disease, so we need objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objectiveity, and ultimately the only way to really know is whether we have cure when we have an objective measure that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there's no other modulation of Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that we have is this 20-minute test on neurologist.
You have to do it in the clinic. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials never is done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would make a scourry to the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have to be a expensive hospital.
It costs 300 percent to study in the neurologic unit, by the way.
And so I want to propose to you a non-conventional way that we're trying to do that, because we're all, at least, virtual, like I did before Janpprave.
This is a video of the vibrating vocal cliff.
This happens in the normal state when someone was creating speech, we can look at the coherent ballet dancers, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we're creating records, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And like ballet, it takes a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child it takes to learn until it comes to speaking.
Now, by the text, we can determine the position of vibrating vocal commands, and as the limbs are also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
On the lower record, you can see an example of irregular vocal mechanics.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
It's crazy, weakness, it's rogue.
The language is sometimes shuffling and shiny, and that's an example of the same thing.
Now, this implications of the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and amending and a direct analysis, combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, we can now tell where someone is in a space between disease and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
So how can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not her non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
Not too small. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are accurate. They're not done by the right-distit-distit-dist.
So they can be done independently.
They're very quick, very much perixty, 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a very large scale.
So these amazing goals we can do now.
We can reduce logistics difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from shared observation.
We can do cheap mass support for clinical trials for the first time, and we can do it for the first time for the whole population.
We now have the possibility to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Now we're doing the first step in this direction, and we're going to start Parkinson's Zone.
With Aculab and patient-Like, we want to take a very large number of votes around the world to own enough initial data for the accomplishments of these goals.
We have charger numbers that are three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's, can call it cheap to leave a few cents. I'll admit that we've reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, say, do we take 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to tell you that they have to give in the phone call, whether that person has suffered from Parkinson's Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them won't get it to the end.
But what we're doing is we're gathering a huge database, under a variety of different circumstances, which is interesting. These circumstances are important because we're kind of trying to expose those things to how the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to give him a little credit because he's done such fantastic work -- has shown that it's also working on the cellular network, which is what makes this project possible, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call an improvement.
That means that people can call the phone, and they can call the test, and people could call them Parkinson's, send their voice, so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You can see the cows of my father and the trais behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just wrapped in the south, which means that wildlife animals like zebras can leave the park any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning and I found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buug.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and the heavens, and that's why our animals mean to us so much.
I learned how to hate lions as a child.
Our warrians are called Morans. They protect our tribe and their treas. They are also responsible for this problem.
They kill and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why there's only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years old who is responsible for his father's cows, and that's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Lionbees fear fire.
But then I realized that it wouldn't really help us, but it's helping the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on going.
I had a second idea. I tried a birdcard.
I wanted the lions to think I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird go back and you go back. And the next time they come, and they say, this thing doesn't move, it's still here.
and they reach out and kill our livestock.
One night, I was listening to the stall. I was walking around it with a torch, and this time the lions didn't catch.
And the signs are fearing light, it's moving.
I had an idea.
I was working all day in my bedroom, and I even took the new radio apart from my mom, and that day it almost took me around. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a power-panger from a motorcycle, and it suggests that if you want to turn it on the right or left, it blinks.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little pearl from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The Solarpan puts the battery, provides the power to the power plant. I call it a transformer.
And the power plant is flashing.
You can see that the halves show outwards because of where the lions come from.
This is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights flashing and the lions believe I'm walking around the stour. I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our homes, and since we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights in, and you can see the lion in the background.
And I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they work really well.
Now, my idea is now used all over Kenya, including other predators like hymen or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me a grant at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helping fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in together where there's no one, and I'm showing the people how to use it.
I was just a boy in the savanna who was chewing his cows. I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of them."
And this is where I stand.
I was invited to create an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to sing. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and we can do it together, side by side, with lions, without any argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language that means this: Thank you.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's next on the list?
My next invention, well, I'm working on an electric fence. An electroconce?
Yes, I know that electrical fences have long been invented, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- Yeah, I tried it a little time, but I've left the attempt again because I got a blow.
The very beginning is hard. Richard Turder, you're something special.
We're going to hire you every step of your walk, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I'd like to share with you my 15 pictures; and not one of them.
There was no kind of executive, no style, no chance of even shooting a picture, not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourist tourists.
My story starts when I was in New York for a talk, and my wife took this picture where I held my daughter on my first birthday, my arm. We were at the corner of 57 and 5th birthday.
So just a year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this is going to go.
When my daughter came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do a father's daughter's Day station to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking for tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to get a complete stranger, he's got a camera.
Nobody ever said no. And fortunately, no one has ever been fooled with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel trips would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just a week taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened that a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than just a shot moment or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us for a week in October to change time and change the time we're going to make of year by year, not just physically, but in everything.
Because while we're doing the same image, our perspective changes as time as it gets to the next time, I can see the life as it is with its eyes, as it is, and how it is, and how it looks.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect every year.
In the recent days, as one of our trips, we walked for a walk, and suddenly we'd be tuned as it was, it shows a red tracker on a dollhouse that they had learned as a little child, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old about that particular place.
She said she remembered her heart of her chest when she first saw the store nine years ago.
And now they look up in New York City because they want to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we're all creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 frames, I'm hardly a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image and ask you not to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 26.44, 57.5/34.0/21.8/14.1 (BP=0.951, ration=0.952)
