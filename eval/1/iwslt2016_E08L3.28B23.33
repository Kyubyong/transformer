When I was 11 years old, I was taken from the sounds of the skier night.
My father stopped on his little, terrible radio show on the BBC.
He was very happy at what was unusual at the time, because he was most stressed out the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone."
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
That morning I'll never forget.
A real school.
The Taliban put the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was five years old, and I was left by my older sister who couldn't be on their own, to a secret school.
and we were both able to go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so nobody could guess where we were going.
We were in our hidden books in a grocery store so that it looked like we were going to run around.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of unfortunate, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risked to our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and every day, the class had to fall out for a week because the Taliban had taken the alarm.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Are you going to succeed?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and women were significant.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan. He was on the side of his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was taken away from his father.
My mother was a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to turn our house into school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- was the first one in his family ever received an education.
It was always clear that his kids would get an education, and his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk to send his kids to school.
I still know that I was so frustrated in the Taliban for the last few years, sometimes I was so frustrated by our lives, of constant fear and the perspective of immissability.
I had a good joke to give, but my father said, "Tin-granddad, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be transported from your house.
But one thing that's going to remain you is that what's in there. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give me."
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have a higher degree than the high school, and when my family didn't have been so strong for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today as a proudly in the middle of the middle school.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was released from his family because he was paying his daughters to school one of the first people that was given me.
He's not just going to be with my graduate degree, but also for me, I was the first woman and I was to drive him to the car with Kabul.
My family thinks me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm global ambassador for 10x0, 100, a global campaign for education.
And so I helped to start with the TED SOLA, and I could use the first Internet to girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school school students are still less likely to do.
It's wonderful to see how students at school would be looking at a great ambition for all of them.
And to see how their parents and fathers would stand for them, even though my parents at the time, despite all the opposition.
So as Ahmed, who is not really his most favorite name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
and he was a daughter, and he was walking home from the LongLA in her village, and she's the death of a bomb on the side of the road for a few minutes.
When he arrived home, the phone would ring, and a voice would beat him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try it again.
He said, "Well, if you want me, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the game because of your old-fashioned and preconceived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that's often happening in the West, which is that most of us have successfully, the success is that a father sees the value of his daughter and that is aware of their success.
That's not to say that our mothers don't make a really important role in our success.
They're often more likely to be careful and compelling of a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan is the support of men.
The Taliban just went a few hundred girls to school -- because it was illegal.
Today, in Afghanistan, three million girls are running the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be looking like America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long, and they're changing the public populations again.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them for them, I see it a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan for me is a country of hope and the unconvenable possibilities, and remember the girl every day, the SOLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you very much.
All I do was I did, I mean, my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but not -- -- -- -- -- -- I have been in Zambia, Kenya, Kenya, the Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on the technical projects of Africa.
I worked for an Italian NGOs OOO, and every single project that we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I think, 21 years ago, we were good at Italy and we were good at work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we found.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book in Zam<unk>s, who was one of the people in Italy, who wanted to show the Sambias Sambias, how to grow food.
We got to the Italian seed in South Zambia, and we got this crazy valley, which leads to Sambesi's Flord, and we trained the local population of the Japanese tomato sauce and pmmini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they started to come to work.
And we were surprised that there was no such a cold valley in agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God, that we are here!"
"Mearn at the time to save people like Sambias before the star."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these gorgeous tomatos. In Italy, they were so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Bambans said, "Look, just like agriculture."
When the tomato sauce were red and red, about 200 pores of fish were coming from the river and everything was happening.
We said to the Sambique, "Oh God, the nilers!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were so brilliant in Italy in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French world did, after I saw what they did, what I was proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least the pestest.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense we didn't have to give African African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid Aid A to Cadisa Moyo, she's a Cologian economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We gave the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what that money has been doing.
Just read their book.
Think about a African woman, what we've been doing was we've been doing.
We are Western people, the imperialists, colonialists, missionists, and there are only two ways we deal with people, and we're going to hypweet them, or we're patriarchists.
Both words come from Latin root, which means "fater," which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
Religicalism: I'm going to treat every other culture, if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronics Veris: I'm going to self-organize every other culture, as if they were my servant.
So these white people in Africa are called "bourry," head, boss.
I was wake up when I read the book "Sally" for Shumy's singing, and he said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, let's go back.
That should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of help is respect.
And this conference morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference, and he asked a pole to the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that is not a neocololic colonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people and created a system called the company who never will be re-engineered, and you will never be motivated to the local community's talent, the servant of the local people who have the trauma to become a better person.
What you do -- you keep your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you sit together with the local community.
We're not working on offices.
We meet ourselves in cafes. We meet ourselves in Kipip.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone a idea.
If that person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own life is the most important of humanity.
We help them find knowledge because nobody can be successful alone.
The person who has the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why not to come to a community and tell people what to do, why do we not listen to them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have been part, and they'll never say what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
So the planning is a little bit of a bat.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be in public meetings.
We work to do one, to do that, has to be made of social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job to be created.
This is the home of the company, the hospital of the business that you sit in your house, where you're in the supermarket and in the cafeteria, helps you find the means to help the resources, your passion in a way to transform life.
I tried this in the eouring, West Australia.
I was a researcher at the time, and I tried to get rid of the damless, where we say other things to do what to do,
And so I went through the streets for the first year and had my first three days of customers, and I helped him. He brought fish into a garage, he was Maiii, and I helped him to go to a restaurant in a mosque, and then they said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can help me?"
I helped these five fish, and they were not selling this wonderful tuna in Albany to 60 cents an hour, but to Japan for 15 dollars to lunch, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you know, you've helped us?" Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do that?" I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- So the government says, "Let's do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We helped 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that go on with loneliness.
So Peter's printer, one of the best business companies of history, died with 96 years ago.
So Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was working on companies. Peter said that design is actually unfinished with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So planning is the death gap of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christch, not knowing what the smartest person of Christhood wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to get you to one.
You have to offer them arguments and privacy. You have to be really great at helping them, and they will come up with them.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who have intelligence and passion?
So for the presentation, you've been paying for most of you today?
"Hake it, passionate people. You've got it.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-spilling fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn machine is not sustainable.
The open-off of the unconditional is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, transport and transport them with them.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Thank you?
The government? Do you remember it?
It will be entrepreneurs. And they're already doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a pre-existic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York City in 1860s.
In 180, they came together and they were speculated, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grew on that pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get around, and it's impossible to do with the crap of six million horses.
Because they went to the crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens 40 years later, in 1900, in the U.S. 1001 automotive companies -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology, had made the race. There were little small factories in the backland.
And then, in the wakeor, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, they have to be offered to be a discontcession.
Otherwise, they're not coming and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate services.
and then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
So the smallest company, to the biggest company, has to be able to do three things: to sell the product to sell great, the market market market market market, has to be great and financial accounting.
You guess what?
We never met one person who could produce something at the same time, sell it, and save money.
That's not what that's happening.
This person was never born.
We've been looking at the last 100 idiographic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wouses, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been, only one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 year-old entrepreneurs in North Ireland, and we start teaching them to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransith Digital System, and the task for the 16-year-old girl is to teach it to the first two pages of Richard Bransansansian Orphans, who often use the word "s" as a word "not" and as often as often as the word "t."
Never again, 32 times, "we."
He was not alone when he started.
No one started a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small specialist in cafeteria and Bars, and Bars, and they sit with the people who are willing to do it for them, what someone here in this gentleman who's talking about this, who tells you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, so can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do I think I'm for someone?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support the organization to help them find the means of the means of the means of the means of the people, and we found that the wonders of the local population, that the culture of the community can be transformed by the social and the economy, only by the passion of the power and the power of their people.
Thank you.
I've been learning five years about how it should be, Alice in the miracles of the country.
And the Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. for communications -- to help the students in communication.
I was scared.
Real fear. Fear with these students with their big brains and their large books and their big ones, I don't trust them.
But when the conversation evolved, he started like Alice, when she was pumping down the tap to the pig, and he saw a door on a new world.
I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed by the idea that they had, and I wanted to find that other miracle land.
I think to open the door, it requires great communication.
We need to really have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy and health, and if we don't know about it, and they don't understand it, they're not going to go forward. I think it's because we're in our responsibility as a non-governmentalist, we're not interested in looking at these conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us in their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, please, please.
I want to show you a couple of ways of how to do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy with with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, well, what?
Let's tell us why this is so relevant to your scientific field.
Don't let us study their feathers, but also tell us that their feathers, the palleys of the nervous structure in our bones, because it's important to understand oopia and treat disease.
And if you describe that what you do, then you will be preventable dictionaries.
Now, the arguments are a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use your "ne" and it's time, but why don't you just say "ne Space" and time," which is much more obvious for us?
We have to make sense of understanding, not the same as the level of their level.
As Einstein said, "Take things as simple as possible, but not simpler."
You can tell us something about your scientific field without having to compete without compromise.
Some things are about giving us: examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can take us into your booth.
And if you put your work, then let's get the points away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "the point?"
What happens when someone else is going to be over and you're only weeks, and you're going to be looking at these dots, your audience.
So a slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the work-making part of our brain, and that's where we're rapidly challenged.
This example of Gene Bons Brown is much more effective. It shows that the particular structure of the feathers is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single sentence, just to use the audience when it loses the thread, it can lose the thread, it can be re-explicable and images that both of our other senses and then creates a deeper understanding of what they describe.
These are just a few ways that can help us open the door and see the wonders of the country that science and technology and technology has been in.
And the engineers I taught, I taught myself to make the "Nat" in my tight contact, I want to sum up everything with an equation.
So look at your science and your writing, and you put it through the popular, so the audience says what's important, and it's going to be different with the passion that you have in your incredible work, and that is, in fact, that we've been able to do something that's meaningful, and that's where we're going to be able to get the new insights from the new things that are made.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved that equation, I really like myself.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can run a crime in the world of mankind in Syria.
You can run a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a song, you can get it up in the soundscoud and be famous.
All of that is possible with a cell phone.
I live in Berlin for a year in 1984.
Let's go back to this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and they showed up on the street.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all of these people who were coming through and asking change were a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot of them. Almost everybody here has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk to you about this.
This is 35830 lines full of information.
Pell data.
And why are these information there?
Because in 2006, the E.U.N. is a rule-based rule.
So this rule of law is a rule for the security supply chain.
The rule of this rule is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service in the entire Europe has to store a range of users to use information.
Who calls who? Who is going to send an email?
Who is sending messages to whom?
And when you use a cell phone, where you are.
All of this information will be stored at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And everywhere in Europe, people were up and said, "We don't want to go."
They said, we don't want to use this trade-off.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of that information on us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to be."
And here you can see, like tens of thousands of people on the streets of Berlin, and they said, "Fouring is not fearful."
And some people even said this could be on the Saturday 2.0.
The Stowers was the poupardi in Eastern Eastern Ireland.
And I'm also wondering if that really works.
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Telegraph, who was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, I asked them, send all the information that you've stored me.
And I asked her one time, and she said, "I didn't get a right answer." Just other blue blue light.
But then I told myself, I want to have this information because it's my life, which is her backbone.
So I decided to put it against a court trial because I wanted to have that information.
But the <unk>Ph. telecommunications said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of it was compared to them.
I'm going to go back to the check, which they'd all demanded information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of the E.U. on the German law was a legitimate case.
So I got this ugly brown pipe with a CD.
And on the CD, that was it.
35830 lines of information.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge date. My hand.
But then I realized that after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with that?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with that information.
I want to do it in the magazine.
Because I want to show people what the security supply system means.
So with time and open data, online solar city, so I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom in, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step that I do, check.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankurturt, with the train to C<unk>amp;C., and how many calls I'm going to run.
And all of this is possible by this information.
That makes you feel a little bit scared.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I call my wife and call me, and we talk a few times.
And then I'll call you a couple of friends and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you and you call you, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, the times they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who the leaders are from the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a construction map for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who is talking to who someone is talking to who is sending an email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we've been imagining that all of these people in the streets of the L Berlins in the fall of 1989, the cell phones in their pocket.
And the singingers knew who was at the demonstration, and when the poker knew who the leaders were, that would probably never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall would not have happened.
And then, of course, the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, the state agency and companies want to store so many information, as they can get over us, online and online.
They want to be able to track our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But even self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
You have to fight for that every day.
So if you go home, you say that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not the old-fashioned.
If you go home, you say your representative, because companies and government states have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company to get the information you've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight yourself to the self-interest in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Central.
This is South Central. The internal stores, rapid restaurants, Braille spaces.
So the city map of the city, and so I realized to change the name of Central Central, so that it changed it in South Los Angeles, whether something is going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
In the same, rapid restaurants, rapid-trims, ponds.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert center in Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drives-Kat, and the Driveyysy.
The comedy is that the Drivetus is more people than killing the Driveyys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the wild-knowable diseases.
So the obesity rate in my neighborhood is higher than five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't see that anymore.
And I wondered how would you feel if you had no access to food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that your food system has on your neighborhood.
I've hoped that the rollmill would buy and sell for use as a transport.
I see the conversation of Starbucks as Starbucks.
And I realized that that's not going to stop.
I realized that the problem is the problem.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel fun at about 45 minutes of presidence to get a apple that's not under the pesticide.
So I planted a food atmosphere in my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park park park park.
It's 45 feet tall.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it in."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I got to the school and my group, the L.A. Green Gridge, and we started planting my food, fruit and fruit, and so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of a professional group, we're putting together by all the social layers and from the entire city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else is going to do it.
The city came to me and he was basically a head-in-contiting, and he said that I had to get rid of my garden, which was a head-panning response to a constellation.
And I thought, "Well, come here, right?
A question for growing food is on a piece of land that you don't care about?
And I thought, "Cool. Her mom with that."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The LAA. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopes, and I spoke about it, and I talked to the city, and with a member of Green, and they signed up a petition on Change.org, and with 900 criteria, we were successful.
We thought we were in the arms.
My town even called it and said they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
LA.A. has the most of the open-up spaces in the United States.
They own 67 miles of hardware.
This is 20 Central Park.
That's enough to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the devil should not find it OK?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my co-power, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
to build its own food as its own food is like print your own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Central Central Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this preconstonnected reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
So I'm in the garden, I'm putting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm going to fill lawns and park plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my actions for this stuff.
You might be surprised by what the ground is all that if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunset is like a sunset, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as a tool for education and transformational development.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
I'd be surprised by how kids are affected by that.
So I'm sure that the therapeutic and the most powerful act you can do is, especially in the middle of the city.
You can get strawbers.
I remember that time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10 in the morning. They were in my backyard, and I got out and looked out and looked at them.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not for the rest of the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just made me feel that I was just empowered to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "On God, no, I'm not afraid that they're going to be cool.
It's on the road.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time I want them to take care of their health."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in D.A.
These are the guys who helped me to run the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how they planted them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even if it was just for a moment.
Green Grounds have already planted about 20 gardens.
and we had 50 people in our instincts, and they were doing it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomato soup, they eat tomatoize.
If they're not offered anything, if they're not shown, how food and bodies affect their bodies, they're blindly blindly eating whatever you're doing with them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're in this thing -- I see color kids that are exactly on the path that they're on for, and they're not going to get there.
I see the garden as a opportunity, where we can train these kids to care about their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a shipboard and turn it into healthy cafeteria.
So, you know, I'm not wrong.
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The comet of sustainability is that you have to stop it.
I talk to people who are going to work and children from the streets, and they take the joy and the pride and the honor to help them build their own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make that sexy.
I want to be the green rebels, the gang, the gang-hound gardener.
We need to turn the picture of the gang star.
If you're not a shower, you're not a gang.
You're going to be able to get a carpenter, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're in a stupid chairs and you want to make a meeting where you talk about it, some kind of stuff.
If you want to meet me, you come to your lawns, in my backyard, so we can plant any kind of picks.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford English dictionary is "nnnnnnnolly-tollaster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "nnnnant" means "n't-for-the-profit politicians."
Despite the 19th century, a new definition of a week, "A Snolly Hary is someone who is on the office, independent of the office or program or program or the success of the power of the monopoly."
I have no idea what to do with the apartment.
In other words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers were not the exact word of the debation.
And that was actually back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary Kassillby Crosby, who was working with the parliament.
She threw him to the Cold Coast and he gave him a man, but he was brave enough, he was enough to win, and finally he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so is so strong, many people believe.
Brently, for example, the English word for the bus.
But that's not true. It's going back to a failed word of public freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you with the U.S. at the time when they've reached independence.
You're looking at the question of how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader a legitimate nation?
and that's been reported for a long time in Congress.
And there was all kinds of extra suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the governor Washington, and others, his great, American George Washington, and again, others, the free of the people in the United States of Washington.
Not so much of that.
Some people wanted to call him king.
They thought it was approved.
They were not monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could work.
But everyone was bored because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the book for the days of a poster, which is always writing, "I've kept the same issue."
The reason for the crash was to be bored and the shortest was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative hospital didn't want Washington to be a kier. They didn't want him.
The king, and maybe even for the ideas of his after that.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most unsafe title that they could find.
This title was "Palking"
President. They didn't invent the title. He didn't exist before. But he meant that someone was running a meeting.
This is something like the prevention of a jury.
He had no longer the size when the "compute" or "talking" or "death."
Sometimes there were little colonial groups and government groups, but it was really unfinished title.
And so the U.S. refused to get him.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up the law and the foreign-tirler.
Who gets serious if he has a stupid little title like the president of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks, the Senate didn't go.
Instead, you're not meant to use the "The Unilever" by first, but they really wanted to make sure that they were not responsible for the ideas of self-interest and institutions, whether or not in the state, whether it's in the state, whether it's the state of the state of the state, that the person who's not, and the people who are not going to do that, and the people who are not so on the United Nations.
You can learn about three interesting things.
One is -- and I think that's the best -- until now I can't figure out whether the U.S. ever has been introduced to the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just signed the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something is temporary -- -- -- -- you're going to wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States of America today is not so hard to sound like this today, right?
It's something that has to do with more than 5,000 nuclear wasteheads that he has and the largest economy in the world and a drone drone and all that stuff.
and the reality is that we've given history the size.
And that's how the Senate won at the end.
They have an respect title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the head of self-esteem -- well, now it was the case.
But do you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, the U.S. and the representative house lost because nobody feels humble when one of them is told you are now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but actually change the reality much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a L.A., about 50 degrees to fight to the Salalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would like to use my black Constury against a pair of brown leatherers and a rocket in the direction of government-fancing, which I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a big deal of war for a long time, but next to Pyjama party and football game to Sam and the Tens and the Ristan-Cander of South African-state protesters who lived in and live with no indigenous rituals and communism and Rwanda, and I knew what I knew before I knew what to do before I was going on.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I've got a more called Afghans, South nations of God's "Serrist," and I'm an atheist, and I think that's a radical artist who lived last nine years in Afghanistan, and I've been working on.
So, there are many really amazing things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like rainwatch. I want art to make the personality and authority and re-creating and re-engineering reality and even using a kind of creative imagination to try and use the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of jihad, <unk>GG, who's the jihad against communists like <unk>amp;Dop<unk>s, and he was able to use religious and political corruption to help.
And what else can be the jihad-filling, as for the parliament, to make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Would I train me! I'm going to do jihad and I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to disappoint these maciosi that spend on national heroes.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rearst," where you're going to be a police department, a false control on the streets of Kabul and cars and cars, but instead of taking money to them, and they give them money to the police in Kabul, and they hope that they will take us 100 percent of them to the U.S.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become for the Cropical conflict.
The war and the awkward views that came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was able to put in the back of the Afghan Afghan, or a pent, or a pendo, or a recrecard, or a recrecient, a self-controadial environment.
And I'd like to see how a simple slick from Kabul between 18996 Apper, to make a dialogue about how today's development development development development in the past-African, in the last-war rhetoric of the gay man, to help the white man and save him from the brown man and maybe even a little bit of civil society.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, they can be misdiagnosed.
But I do, because I have to, because I need to, because the geography of self.
That's my burden. What's your one?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I work for a while as a model.
For 10 years, exactly.
I feel that now in the room, there was a kind of unconditional tension, because I wouldn't have to wear that dress.
Fortunately, I'm going to do something more about changing.
This is the first time someone in the TED stage, so you can appreciate yourself so happy, I think.
If a few women were really excited when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I read it later on Twitter.
I also find myself that I'm quite privileged because I can change 10 seconds in a very short sequence of what you think about me.
And I don't think that anyone has the opportunity to do that.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear it anyway.
The hardest part is to raise the sweater above my head, because you're all going to wake me up, so you're not doing anything until it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
It's powerful, but it's a picture of a super-screen.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And I had never come up with this picture -- I had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should call my back oil and my hand in the hair.
And besides surgery or the wrong cals I took two days to work, there are just very few ways of changing our fears, and our fears, although it's absolutely unchanging, it's not a huge impact on our lives.
Fear to be honest for me is to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and I call this a sexy girl.
Now I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but I'm going to be at the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy, and you might ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and primitive, which is to be programmed to be biologically, but also as big, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that was paid for me.
I know there are people who are skeptical about this point. And maybe some kind of fashioners from the line, and they might say, "Haltomi.com, Tyra. Joan Sman Sman Wooh.
And I'm going to talk to you about the model of your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at the Pittsburgh, all the modules have been counted on the ground, each one that was arrested, and that in 677 or less than six percent, they didn't know.
The next question that I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model if I grow up?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give this little girl is, why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can be president of the U.S., or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-in-gsychologist, which is absolutely wrong, because you would be the first one."
When they say to this amazing, no, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "Who do I call my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head of the American bird, or the business manager of H<unk>amp;MMM, or the next Steven Meisis.
To say, you want to be a model later, like you're going to say you're going to win the Jack of the Swto.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a model of knowledge, because it's different from heart surgery, it can now be permanent.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is exactly there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Camer, we want to run a photo," then it's going to be the last one, and then you go back to the back of that arm, and then you're on the back, you're on your head, and you're just moving back to the side of the side, and you're going to see 300, and you
It looks something like this.
I hope that I'm going to be less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finished school and you've done a whole life and you've done a few jobs, you can't say much more, and if you say that you want to be president of the U.S., but in your life, "10 years of underwear," you're going to be curious."
The next question that I'm often asked is, "Am you going to feed all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much the photos are turned, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the first time I had a Bikini, and I didn't even have that time.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
And I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this song.
My friend had to join me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a guy who was a French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-C magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're designs, and they're constructable by a group of professionals, from Haptyl and makeup and animators and photographers and protylists and all their assistants and their assistant and the post-war production. That's not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Do you have things for free?"
Yeah, I have a lot of 20-foot-touchs that I can never wear, except just because the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had lost my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was on a red light, and of course we were stopped. It only took me: "Excuse me, Mr. Words!" and we had to go on.
I paid this costless thing to look at my appearance, and not because of my personality, and there are people who are looking for their appearance and not paying attention to their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 140,000 teenagers who were stopped last year and manipulated, 85 percent black black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 177 young young, male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question: "Am I going to stop?"
But I said, "How often am I going to be? When I'm going to stop?"
I found out that in the United States, I found that 53 percent girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is up to 78 percent when they were 17 percent old.
The last question I've ever asked you is, "How is it that a model?"
And I think they expect that answer, "If you're a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little, and you're got a little hair, you feel really happy, you feel really excited."
And we give a answer that might be given to this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel, and it's great, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
Everything is true, but it's just half the story, because we never say what I never said before the camera, I've never said before the camera, "I feel confident."
And I feel insecure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask, "Am I happier if I had thin legs and bright hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool hair and they're the most beautiful ones, and they're probably more vulnerable women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really difficult to me to move a more honest balance, because on the other hand I felt very uncomfortable to join me and say, "I got all the benefits to the stack that I've been put in my favor." And it doesn't feel good, and that's not going to make me happy."
It was really difficult to use a legacy of oppression and race when I was one of the largest users of it.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great, and I think I've managed to get this here, before 10 or 20 years, and my career has been completely unhealthy, because I wouldn't say, I wouldn't be told my first job, or I would not have been asked, or I would have paid that to be so much of college.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our own preferences and failures rather than the failure.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in ex-cility, "Son, Laddafi, Gaddafi's resistance.
But never will be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been almost two years since the Frewby revolution, inspired by the waves of mass-pits and in both the most primitive revolution.
I connected with many other sacreders, and outside, and outside of nowhere, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyranny Gadadia regime.
And it was there, a big revolution.
And boy, grand-granddaughter women and men stood in the first row, gave the end of the regime, held Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They've demonstrated an investigative courage by putting it against the brutal dictator of Gaddafle.
They showed a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the far east, to the farest West, to the South.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to free our country and fight the tyrant.
But the Gaddafi has left a huge hospital, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the protocols.
Over four decades, Gaddafovis and the infrastructure and the infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the blindy society.
The devastation and the challenges, as many women, I would say, are able to rebuild the civil society of Lyyia, and we asked them to be a legitimate and more open-source and more globalizing democracy.
Near 200 organizations, and at the same time, after the Gaddafis in Benghaz, in Benghaz, almost 300 miles in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exil, I came back to Lyyia, and I started working with this unique enthusiasm, and I started workinghops to organize the issues of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding of Mayy, a movement of women, leaders of various life, who are their goal, that it is public for the sociological empowerment of women and to be in our right-being and to our right-being as a result of democracy.
In the election election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I was campaigning a democratization of peace conservation, Karensy women to reach a law, a law, no matter what citizens should be, no matter what the right to do with the context, and to vote for the law and to the political parties and all the time, and to compete with a political rule, and to put a regular score in the horizontal and to make a rule of the Internet.
At the end of the initiative, we were taken and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's national prosecination in the first year for 52 years.
But long-term, the euphor of the elections and the entire revolution for <unk> because every day we were to have new news on violence.
And we were thinking about the news for the ancient mosques and the Sufi leaders.
In another morning, we got the message on the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to the message.
After another morning, the suicide bombers were signed by the army.
And indeed, we are at the governing of the military and their ongoing over-of-the-the-the-the-the-day-day-day-day-day-day-human prisoners and their pre-expression of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary spirit, polarized, and moved from the ideals and principles of the political, dignity, social justice, which they were beginning to do.
Fear, intentful and revenge became the icon of the <unk>Fol<unk> War of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our discourse and elections.
I'm already here today to say that we've made a nation, the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or safety or safety in Lyia.
Did the hardest and the shift between women and male candidates have been forced to peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominate by selfish politics of dominance and purpose and both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones that were missing, but the female values of compassion, the Gade and the unhealthy.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a consensus as it took to the elections, which has only helped the polarization and mutatoryization.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than they need the numerically, quantitative, quantitative of the female.
We have to stop doing the name of anger and demand a day to make the revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Goodle.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only does the next values, but also to the extent: Gouver, instead of working, instead of lacking competition, instead of not a lack of action.
These are the ideals that need a waste of war to be able to get peace to the end.
Because peace has an alchemia and in this alchemie, it's about the defending of the feminist and masks and masks of view.
That's the real unconditional.
And we have to do that in general, before we do it in sociology.
After a stop from the Koran, "Salam," "<unk>" -- "the word of the Good God of God, shit."
The word "rave", again, that's known in all the late 19thurian traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "the Species" and "in" -- "inemine" and symbolically, the female's rights, the man's wife's wife and the female's female's wife, and all of the peoples have been executed.
And just like the mother, the patient, the embryo, who grows in it, is completely so much of the inherentness of compassion.
And so we told us, "My God's favorite is all things that are happening."
And so we told us, "My Gadenade has been in front of my mess."
And should all of us be the arks of the Gade.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought that my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were looking at the story of Kim Il, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often asked myself what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all of that changes at the time.
At seven years, I saw a public opening, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer from hunger myself.
But in 1995, my mother took a letter, from my sister's sister,
And he said, "If you were here, our five family members will not be there anymore in the world, because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're in the ground, and our bodies are so weak, that we're soon die."
I was so shocked.
I heard that for the first time, people were suffering in my country.
I was on the train for a little bit, and I saw something horrible that I couldn't delete from my memory.
A penteless woman was on the ground, and a broken kid in her arm was laughing in her mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy to care and care about their families.
In the mid-'0s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans liked the famine, and many more people survived because they ate grass, beetles and caucal.
and the waste rate became increasingly, so at night, everything was worse, except the lights of China on the other side of the pyramid that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and neighbors at night.
This is the river of the amid, who is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very smooth and allow North Korean drones to escape.
But many people die.
I used to see the bodies moving into the river.
I can't tell you how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the devastating years of the famine to get to China.
I just thought I was separated for a short time from my family.
I never thought it was 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be as North Korean refugees, but soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare ever, when I was caught by the Chinese police, and was sent to the police department.
Someone was accused of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese ancestry and asked me countless questions.
I had this fear, I thought, I would explode my heart.
If anything unnatural seems, I could be locked and inserted.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made it to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the address, a official said to the other one: "This was a wrong thing.
She's not North Korean man."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are sending messages to foreign proylyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they were caught, they were finally released by tremendous international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China, and they were released to North Korea, where they were tortured, or they were locked in publicly or publicly.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, there's many other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
and after they learn a new language and work, their world can be put in a moment.
After 10 years of abuse, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I went to South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
I also saw the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of the inside, we're very different from each other, because of 67 years of the part.
I was walking through a identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life was not easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording interview at university.
Just as I became more normal in my new life, I got an amazing call call.
The North Korean authorities started the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family forced to move around, to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly so quickly, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to go back and get an incredible route back to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China and made me on the northeast border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, more than 2,000 miles across China, and then back to South Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we got almost several times.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the speculation of everybody, and he started asking questions.
My family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official, I decided to be in the office, and I told him that she was a child, and I was at her foreman.
He looked at me, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to use it to the most iconic border, but I had to almost raise all my money to make the border of Lus's border.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated, because of illegal border.
After I paid money and a bakery, my family was released within a month, but for a moment, my family was replicated again in the capital of Lia.
That was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to protect my family to freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Korean choir.
I went and I went to the intergressive department and the police department, and I tried to free my family, but I had not enough money to pay for money to pay money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised by being a stranger.
In broken English and I explained to my situation and not to police, and he went to a bank engine, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about all the heart and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The earlier foreignist designed for me to have a new hope that the North Koreans needed, and he showed me the passion of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I re-wroduced again in South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Most North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they come into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, the English, the professional education and many more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with families, and we send them information and money that helps you change North Korea from inside.
I had so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to make my dream of droughts to succeed in Northern North Koreans, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I just have a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good sights.
He can't talk, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't.
Remii knows what love is.
He's going to divide it, and he's going to give it a little bit of trouble.
He's not stupid. He doesn't look at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and she's just telling you, "He never told a lie."
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to be trying to not even remember, I remember a thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown is.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He's got absolutely impossible memory.
but he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate fries, but he reminds me of the newspaper year of every song on my iPod, talking about it when he was four, when he was the first result of the teombet on my arm, and the Lady Gagasas birthday.
Don't listen to it?
But many people don't agree.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they often have been understood and understood.
But what motivates my heart and my soul was empowered, although that was the case, although it was not as usual, it was only one that was extraordinary -- with autism, and it was extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with the term "compassionism," it's a complex disorder of the brain, the social communication that is changing learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a different feature of every individual, so that's Remii is so different from Sam.
And the world will recognize every 20 minutes of autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there is no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been in autism, but I can't remember myself for a day.
I was only three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very upset.
He didn't want to play what the other babies did, and he didn't really care about me at all.
Remi lived in his own world, and he was forced to use his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars, in a row, to fill the washing machine and eat everything that was coming in.
And when he was older, he was different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the shaman and the never end of hyperactivity, something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had ever been.
It's extraordinary.
Now I can't believe that there was some more challenging moments in my family, moments I wish that they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these things I would not want to compete against normality.
Normalness is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It means that there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say something to Remi and Sam and you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift, and in all of us, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance for scale, progress and change dies in the moment where we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Edoc Edon has served us with awe and curiosity, and this photograph on a project of a apple, and with a mass of radiation, only a hundredth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Ftototo-Mill photographer, a new engineering technology that's so fast that it can create slow-time footage of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look at the outside of our view, or if you can't see an <unk>-ray in your body and really ask what we're doing with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser map and I take it in a 10-cent-one second -- that's several extra dimensions -- I'm going to create a package of photos that's hardly a thin-sized and this photon-tube project, that project will move in speed, and in speed, and as I said, "Well, a million times a day a product faster than a normal project."
So if you take this project, this photons pack, and you shoot it in this bottle, like these photons in the bottle?
What's the light like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, think about this, the whole event is actually twice less than a nanotatch -- so long that light takes to take back, but I'm going to try to make this video 10 billion to make the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola has not financed this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze it, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle with a photonsuit that starts to move through and eventually melt through the inside.
A part of the light is moving out on the table, and you see that spread of waves.
Many of the photons are finally reaching the wheel and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's moving around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are coming out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project, and you take it back and you slow it back the same route, and you slow the video back to 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here to see the film?
Day one day? No, one year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about something that is still a life-of-day photography?
You can see again, like this wave on the table, the Tomber and the wall on the background.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
And it seemed like I was painting the nature of nature, at one time, a photo image, but of course it looks like our eye is a collection of images.
But if you look at these Toms, you'll see that when the light is streaming over the Tom's lights, that will remain completely dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is more likely, and the light is coming around in your house, and after a few hundred seconds, it's coming back.
So in the future, if this Ftototo camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible to go to a supermarket and find if an fruit is still under the room.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you do a photo with a short quality of air, you have very little light, but we're going to be able to add a billion times faster than your shortest air time, so you get it as you're not doing anything.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons, and we're drawing it in a million, and we're going to do it again, and we're going to combine it with very smart synchronically, and we're going to combine this gigabytes of data, and we're going to do this, and we've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and make it very interesting.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future supercomputer: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to turn a light on the door.
It will be replicated in the room, a part of it will turn back to the door, and eventually finally back to the camera and we could use these more and more nuanced-tuned light-making processes.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
You see our Ftoto camera on the left.
The wall is hidden in a soup, and we're going to let the light back to the door.
After our paper was released in the U.C. Publicications, it was made of Nature.com.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project, and they're going to be tipping into this wall, and these photons are going to be put together in all directions, and some of the photons will be taken into the hidden soup that will be breaking the light, and then then again, again, a wall of light will be a tiny light and a tiny bit of light that will come back to the camera, but they will get it in a slightly more interesting time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our FtotoM camera has some unique abilities.
It's got a very good time-effective, and it can look at the world at speed of light.
And of course, we know that by the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of the distance is.
So by pushing a laser, we can take a raw picture, which -- how they look on the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-throughs, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We've got to do something a little bit before we can do this in the lab in practice, we could build cars that can avoid and recognize what's going on behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous survivors, by looking at the windows, we can turn through the windows, or we can build the final end, or we can build the end of the back, and we can see the inside the body, and we can see the pillars, and we can see
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, that's very challenging, which is really a call for scientists, now, now, to think about Ftoto-Mill photographer, because there's a new visualization process that could actually solve the next generation of medical problems.
So, like Docon, even a scientist, a science has become a art of the ultra-stifth photography, and I realized that all of these things we're using is that every time we're using not just a scientific sequence, we can do a new version of the computer, and we can also create a new kind of memory, and we can't just take that light back of time and we can're not just looking at that light.
But it's also something that happens here.
If you look at the waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we were almost recording in the speed of light, weird effects and Einstein would like to see this picture incredibly.
The order to happen in the world, in the events, appear in the camera, in the window, so by leveraging the relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So whether it's about photography, or building a new visual framework for medicine or new exhibitions, since we have all of the data to do with our own and hope to hope that the co-in-in-in-in-in-tist and the research community, we should be willing to show us to stop to step around the next step, and we should start to step up to the next-to-to-to-the-the-step.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our people can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street so many arguments are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like a stick, and use collisions and circles.
The projects of my questions were made, how much money would you pay to raise my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without any other?
How can we share our memories from the buildings better and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for existing homes so that our communities and our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is moved from the giant es that had been held for hundreds of years, hysterically and shade shadows, and I trust a city where there is always music.
I think every time someone ever ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of our houses in America.
I'm thinking about where I was near this house, and I was going to be able to make it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in now in life.
But I'm really hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and forget what's really important.
And then with the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the house into a giant box, and I wrote with a wall of the gaps: "I want to die, I want to die, everyone, I want to take a piece of chalk, thinking about their life and their hopes in that public space.
I wasn't sure what I was expecting to do with the experiment, but I was still walking around the wall next day, and she was growing and she was growing.
I want to share some sentences with you, which were written by the people on the wall.
I want to die, I want to be under piracy."
"I want to die, I want to be at the latest date."
"I want to die." I want to sing for millions of people."
"I want to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die, I want to live in touch."
"I want to die again, I want to keep them in my arms."
"I want to die, I want to be somebody's work gallery."
"I want to die." I want to be my own."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of the people brought me to laugh to the wine and to the hardest times during the difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and thinking about a new and more inclusive way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and remembering what we're most important in our growing and changing.
I did this last year, and I've given hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've been building a construction company in the world, like Kasazan, South Africa, South Africa, Australia, Australia, Australia and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces, if we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often discouraged to talk about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that most of us are empowered.
The idea of death really makes us feel life.
Our common spaces show us the best and our individuals as individuals, and as a community, and with more possibilities, to share our hopes and stories, that people can be able to help us around us not only to make better places, they can help us better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in the most co-ex-ex-social mathematics. I think, a very special problem for anyone who's involved with this, that we're working on the idea that we're a business maker.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain what I do today.
Stame is one of the most human activity.
We are excited about the audition of the most-woman ball and the teats, as you're going to see the same.
So for the ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities and abilities, and possibly a fundamental predictive that a genetic component could have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slow slowly, and that's what it does for me to the people I met Janel Stit, who was on his time, was a ballet for the experience of a ballet virus.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people living on this disease, and they have to live with the unhealthy symptom as weaknesses, cuths, and more things that cause that disease, so we need objective ability to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only possibility to know whether there is cure, if we have a objective measure that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there's no biomaterials of Parkinson's disease, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. And the best thing that you can do is that this 20-minute test test test test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive. It means that outside clinical studies, it never will.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a professional tour of mine to the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't take a lot of expensive hospital workers.
It costs 300 percent to go to the neurologic field, by the way.
So I want to propose to you that I'm going to argue that I'm going to try to do this, because we're all all in a certain sense, virtual, virtual, like I met Janis's novels.
So here's a video of the vibrating vocal odor.
This is what happens in the healthy state, when someone was making a speech, we can look at the common ballier, because we have to coordinate all of these muscle cells if we could make the sounds, and we all have the genes for Fox2, for example.
And as ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it begins.
and we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal odor, and so the limbs are also affected by Parkinson's brain stimulation.
At the lower end, you can see an example of irregular vocal evidence.
We see the same symptoms.
It's still true, weakness, ephemity.
The language is even more and more blind and lonely, and that's an example of it.
And this impacts on the voice, sometimes, but sometimes with digital microphones and the risk of the analysis of the data, combined with new machine learning that we're now very advanced, so we can now find that we're now here where someone is in a votot and health between the sounds of the voice.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not the two-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-one. The tester in neurologists.
It's not too little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are exactly the same. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done in their own self-replicated.
They're very quick, they're probably 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're extremely cheap, you can use it in a very large scale.
So this amazing goals we can do now.
We can reduce logistic difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to take routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from overlapping observation.
We can do cheap mass support for clinical trials and first of all the population for the entire population.
Now we have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today we're going to do the first step in this direction, we start the Parkinson's disease-based.
With Aulab and patient-Like, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data to help for this goals.
We have a call for the three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who can call, without Parkinson, can be cheap to leave a few cents for a few cents, and I'll admit that we've already reached six percent of our goal in eight hours.
Thank you.
If you have samples, we say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who's healthy?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to tell you that when they call, whether that person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we are in this position to figure out what the actual markers for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, their 86 percent accuracy is the same?
It's much better.
My students Thisisis -- I have to give him the big work because he's done so amazing -- now, it's been working on the cell network, which is to allow this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a improvement.
That means that people can use -- people can call the phone and call the test, and people could call Parkinson's disease, they send their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you very much. Max Super, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the south of the Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows behind my father and behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the South, in fact, in the south, and that means that wildlife animals can be able to leave the park for the same time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night, and I woke up in the morning and I found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only bumble.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believe that we came together with our animals and the wildlife of the sky, so that's why our animals are so much.
I learned lions as a child.
Our warrior Morans. They protect our tribe and our ancestors. They were also supported by this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years of all the cows for his father, and that's how it was for me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help us, but help the lions help the cows see better.
But I didn't go. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird, and you go back, and you come back, and you come back and you say, this thing doesn't move, it's still there.
and they take it and kill our livestock.
One night I was leaving the Stall. I was walking around with a pistle, and I was walking around it, and this time the lions didn't.
And the lions fear of light, that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working in my room as a little boy, and I used to use the new radio to my mother, and the day, she made me almost a lot of stuff about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a motor for a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn your right or left or left. He's blinking.
And I was going to turn a switch to the lights and turn the lights.
This is a little halel from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panels are releasing the battery, the battery, the battery, the electricity to the server. I call it a transformer.
And the correct store is bright.
You can see that the saints are out of the outside, because they come from there, the lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are blinking and the lions think I'm going to go to the skace. And I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and since then we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped from that.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yeah."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've spent seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good at the same time.
My idea is now used in Kenya, for other predators like hygiene or leopard seals, and the lights also serve elephants from sea farms.
My invention took me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse School School School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved, and it helps by donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in the same place where there is no one, and I show people how to use them.
I just took a boy from the savanna, who was crying his father, and I saw planes over me and said, "Eadorrow, I'm going to sit in one!"
And here I am.
I had to be an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot, that's my big dream.
I used to be bullets, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can be together with the men, with the lions, without the argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n<unk>. In my language, that means, "I thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yeah.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
So my next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. A electrode answer?
Yeah, I know that electric blocks have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right, yeah, yeah, I tried it, but I've given the attempt to try again, because I got -- I got a stroke.
At the very beginning, Richard Turer, you're something special.
We're going to be free you for each step to your home, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography, but I want to share my passion with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and not one of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even an insect's lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot from random tourists.
My story starts when I was in New York, and my wife took this picture, where I hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57 and five.
So just a year later in New York, we were able to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where that's going on ...
When the third birthday of my daughter came to me, "Hey, why do you not take Sabina to New York, and do it a father's first-granddad to continue to lead the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture, if you're in a completely stranger's camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, he's never even given anyone with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these trips would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what was happening on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a shot moment or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us in October, and for the time and our time, and how we are coming year after year, not only physically, but in everything.
Although we always make the same picture, our perspective changes for times, as they're going to reach new corridors, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and how they see it.
This very intense time we spend with each other is something we estimate, and we expect every year.
So, recently, during our travel, we went for a walk, and suddenly they were on the ground, and it shows a red brand on a soup store where they loved as a kid, earlier in the day.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been at the age of five years in that particular place.
She said that she remembered her heart from her chest when she saw the store at the first time.
And now they look at high schools in New York because they really want to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious brain of memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not very close to a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image and ask you not to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
BLEU = 23.33, 54.2/30.2/18.2/11.1 (BP=0.973, ration=0.973)
