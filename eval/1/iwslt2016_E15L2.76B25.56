When I was 11 years old, I was a little boy in the hallway.
My father listened to his little gray radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was rather unusual at the time, because he was most likely to get the news out of a lot.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father making it very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban moved the power in Afghanistan when I was six years old, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so for five years, I was friends for five years, and I was left with my older sister who was no longer allowed to go alone to a secret school.
It was the only way we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so that no one could guess where we went.
We put our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to buy.
We've been in a house where we've been living in 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was kind of indifferent, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
All the time, all the classes had to be out of the class for a week because the Taliban had swallowed gum.
We'd never know how much they knew about us.
Forget?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and that daughters were valued.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
One of the outsider from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to go to school and was distracted by his father.
My mother was a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to turn our house into school for girls and women out of the neighborhood.
And my father -- and here's the first one in his family ever received education.
For his own time, his kids were always aware that their children were going to be educated, even though the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much larger risk to send his kids to school.
I still know that in the years I was so frustrated with the Taliban, sometimes, that we were so frustrated by our lives, by the constant fear and the perspective of immissibility.
I was very lucky to give up, but my father said, "Tdaughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be distributed out of your house in war.
But one thing you're going to always remain is that what's in there. And even if we have to pay for our blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed in the decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have had higher degrees than the high school, and if my family hadn't been put so strong for my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly Palestinian of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was defunated by his family, because he proved to send his daughters to school, one of the first people who was congratulating me.
He's not just paying attention to my graduate school, but also that I was the first woman and I'm driving him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a worldwide campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start the first, the first Internet, and maybe the only intern for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school school school school school girls are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to see the most passion for them to take their own chance.
And seeing their parents and fathers stand for them, and as my parents at the time, despite all due to the opposition of conflict.
As Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face too, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
A month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and she's gone through a bomb on the side of the road for only few minutes.
When he came home, the phone rang, and a voice threatened to use his daughter to go to school, she would try again.
And he said, "Well, I'm going to kill me now, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future in the game for having a cartoon and over-expecting imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that's often being prevented in the West: the majority of us who succeedes have a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who knows that their success is also success.
I don't mean to say that our mothers don't have an important role in our success.
They're often the ones that are often more likely to be considered and compelling for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, men's support is essential.
The Taliban just went to school a few hundred girls, because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls push the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be looking at America, so different.
Americans see how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not for the duration, and the people who are changing with the decline of the U.S. population.
But when I see my students in my school, and their parents who are trying to use them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-lasting change.
Afghanistan for me is a country of hope and the unbridled possibility, and remember the girl going to the SOLA every day.
Just like I did, they have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as I do, was my life -- was shaped by the work of seven years ago in Africa as a young man.
1971 to 1977, I look very young, but I'm not -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to projects with the engineering collaboration with Africa.
I worked for an Italian NRO project, and I failed every single project we put on the legs.
I was desperate.
I mean, 21 years ago, we thought we were a great bunch of good people, and we were making good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we used to be.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book in the Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people of Sambias how to grow food.
We came to Italy with Italian seed in South Zambia, into this blunt valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We taught the local citizens to grow Italian tomatoes and pcini.
Of course, the local people didn't really care about it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came to the same.
We were surprised by the fact that there was no agricultural crops in this fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Mave only time to save the people of Sambias before the star."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these magnificent tomatos. In Italy, they got so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the rabbit said, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato bubble became red, about 200 bites of ropes were coming out of the river and around.
We said to the Sambins, "Oh my God, the royal!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were Italian-fetched in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the Americans did, what the French did. After I saw what they were doing, I was proud of my project in Zambia.
We at least fed the pine.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've not given to the existing African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a multigian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given a billion dollars of the African continent in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what that money was doing.
Just read their book.
Think about a African woman who we've done.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We hypnotize them, or we are patriarchists.
Both of these words come from the Latin root, which means "father"
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my kids. I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm going to keep every other culture as if they're my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bwana, head.
I was delighted when I read the book "Salls Beautiful" in the book, and he said, especially in economics, when people don't want help, they leave it in peace.
This was the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the floor, and he said, "Can you imagine a city that is not neocolal?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just respond to people, and I created a system called business promoted, where never will be initiated, never gets somebody's responsibility, but you become the provocative of the local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you sit down with the local community.
We don't work from office.
We find ourselves in cafeteria. We find ourselves in bars.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to close with friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
Now, if that person doesn't like what you're supposed to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in human history.
We're helping them find the knowledge because nobody can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one trap: Why not to come to a community rather than to say what they should do, why don't we listen to them, but not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
entrepreneurs never have a part of it, and they will never say to them what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Let me show you a little bit of a little bit of a sudden.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working on one to do that, to do it, we have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the pediatrician, who's sitting in your house with you, at your kitchen table, and in the coffee store, helps you find the means to help you to transform your passion in a way to move life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I trained at the time, and I tried to escape the disengage, where we say what to do.
And so I was walking only in the first year, and I had my first three days of my first clients. I helped him. He was a fresh fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then he came to the fishermen and said, "You brought the maor. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers, and I didn't work together and sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents of K<unk>Kilo, but to Japan for 15 dollars sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
So one year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I'm holding my mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- -- -- so the government says, "Let's do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on on in loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best corporate CEOs in history, died at 96 years ago.
Peter's Professor, who was a philosophy professor, before he was working on companies, and Peter said, programming is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics.
So programming is the death of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, not knowing what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to you in your mind.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to be clustered.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are passionate and passion?
What I'm sure you've liked for the most of your talk today?
"Sear, passionate people. You applaud that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-spirestest fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The fire-incess engine is not sustainable.
The free-felf" of preservation is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, build, transporting, and share them with them.
The technologies we have not existed for that.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futurist magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts invited to talk about the future of New York City in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they were speculated, and they were speculated, and they were going to be in the city of New York, and the conclusion was a popular: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grew on this pace, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get ready to do with the dung of six million horses.
Because they were already out in the dung.
1860 they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were tiny factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be offered to them some disclosure.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
and then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all the three things that are capable of selling is to be grand, the market market market market has to be grand, and the financial governance has to be huge.
You guess what?
We never met one person who at the same time will make something, sell and help them take care of it.
That's not what it's like.
This person was never born.
We've done research and looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have been so popular, one, one, no one was founded just one person.
Now we teach 16 year-old Americans in Northland, and we start teaching them the first two pages of Richard Bransons Imscopy. The job is that 16 year-old, in which, in the first two sides of Richard Bransons Imscience, often how he uses the word "to" and how often the word "we" and how often does it.
Never "I," and 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where a group of developers who have a small education system in cafeteria and Bars. They're dedicated to the work they're going to do for them, what someone in this gentleman has done about this skepticism, and someone tells you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you believe I find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting organizations in helping them find the means of the means and the people. We found that the wonders of the local government can transform the culture and the economy, only by detecting the passion and the quality of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should be Alice in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to challenge educational education.
I was scared.
Real fear. Fear to these students with their big brains and their large books and their large, I don't trust my own words.
But as the conversation evolved, it was like Alice, when she was pumping down to the electrofine and saw a door to a new world.
I also felt like when I was doing conversations with the students, and I was amazed at the idea that they had and wanted other of these miraculous land to be discovered.
I think that we need great communication to open this door.
We need to really have great communications from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that face our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, then it's not going to go. I think that it's our responsibility as a non-cientist, to look at these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, please, hang on.
I want to show you a few ways that you can do this, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're engaged with, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, well, what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that their chests are investigating, but also tells us that their chests, their pots, their porous structure in our bones, are examining because they're important to understand and treat osteosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to be discriminated.
Now, the technical words are a barrier to the idea of your mind.
I'm sure you could use your "go" and "lit" at a time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
We're not really going to turn our thoughts down the same way as your level.
As Einstein said, "Take things as easy as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific field without trying to work with any tradeoffs.
So a few things are related to this. Expecting, examples of stories and analogies. So this is how you can pull you into your closet.
And if you present your work, let's go out the positions.
Have you ever wondered why it's called the point?
What happens when someone stands? Another one is once in the room, and with these points, your audience is going to be your first one.
So a slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the scientific work-making part of our brain, and that's how we're very quickly advancing.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more potent. It shows that the particular structure of the feathers is so stable that it even became the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick is to use one individual, just by drawing sentences that the audience can once lose the thread, or reuse images and graphs that also make us more deeply aware of what it is.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open these towers and see the wonderland, the science and the technology.
And because the engineers I've been teaching have taught me to put the "Nerdrace in me in narrow, I want to sum up everything with an equation.
Look at your science, your data points and your writing words, they divide through the relevance, so the audience says what's important, and multiply that with the passion that you have for your incredible work, and then you have this unthinkable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you've solved this equation, I'm very afraid of it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give it a personal freedom.
You can actually film a drug with a cell phone. You can shoot a crime in Syria.
You can tweet a phone and launch a news and launch it in Egypt.
And you can take a song with a cell phone, you can get it out of the sound cloud and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
You can see there, like hundreds of thousands of people going on in the street and showing up.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all these people who were coming out and asking change had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone on it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everyone today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about myself and my cell phone and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines of information.
Corow data.
And why are these things there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. missionary issued a rule.
This is a policy line called the Department of Honurance.
The rule of the Internet is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service provider in Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who is going to send an email?
Who is going to send a text message?
And when you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is saved at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And all over Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want that."
They said, we don't want to have this land supply.
We want to store self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want that."
And here you can see, tens of thousands of people migrated on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Funity instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be at the time of the turn of 2.0.
The Stasi was the headblimpice of Eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering if this really works.
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declar Telegraph, who was the biggest telephone company in Germany then, and I asked them, please, sent me all the information that you've saved me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get the right answer. Just fucking Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that's her cataloging.
So I decided to put a court process against it because I wanted to have that information.
But the German telecom said, no, we're not going to give you that information.
And it was at the end of it as a comparison.
I'm going to pull back the envelope for which they all demanded me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court determined that the introduction of the E.U. line was a German law enforcement response.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD, this is what it was.
35.30 lines of information.
First, I looked at it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My house.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm asleep at night, I'm sleeping.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make it published.
Because I want to show people what's called the supply of the U.S.
So over time, online and open data town, so I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankfurt to the train to C<unk>n, and how many calls I'm going on.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes you a little scared.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, it's just like this, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then some friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call yourself up and you call you, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they're calling each other when they're going to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who's talking to who's talking to who's emailing, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we'd imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was on the demonstration, and when the Stasi knew who the leader was, that maybe that would never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And even after that, the fall of the iron curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so many information about how they can get over us online and online.
They want the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all well.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you still have to fight for your self-determination today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, say your maidenders, just because companies and government have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central. The spiral stores, rapid restaurants, Brakill.
So the city planners come in and they thought to change the name of South Central America, so that it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
New Delhi, rapid restaurants, Braille.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivet, and the Drivebys.
The weird thing is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles from sacred diseases.
So obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really appreciate that.
And I was wondering how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food if you're going out of the house, you see the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I've taken the chairs and I've been sold as a means of transport.
I see dialogue centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what I have to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't really like anything to get an apple under-minute marriage.
So I planted a food heat from my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it in."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grounds, and we started planting my food and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a pre-medative group, put together by all the social layers and from all the city, and it's completely voluntary and everything we're doing is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he introduced me basically a station of control, and he said that I needed to remove my garden, which was a proprietary to a connotation.
And I thought, "So, come on, right?
A set of reports for growing food from a country that doesn't care about you?
And I thought, "Cool. Take it with it."
Because this time, it wouldn't happen.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city station, and I had a member of Green, and they agreed a petition on Change.org, and with 900 Signatures, we succeeded.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My town actually called up and said they were supporting it and love what we're doing.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest bricks in the United States in the country.
They have 4,200 miles in the hardware store.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato cells.
Why the hell shouldn't they find that?
And then you get 1,000 seeds from the plant to grow, 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, the value of a dollar is given to fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my feed message, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To build its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more ashamed to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Porning is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's shaking the walls, I'm going to make my lawns and indoor air.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my niece for this stuff.
You'd be surprised to see what the ground is all that can be done if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden become an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
I'd wonder how kids affected.
I'm sure that we have the most therapeutic and the most audacious act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You can get strawberries.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out, and she looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that just empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum Devil, no, I'm not afraid they're going to blow out.
And it's on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take care of their health."
Another time, I put a garden in the homeless house in D.A.
These are the guys who helped me to get the truck out.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it affected them, and how it affected them, and how it was their mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even if it was just a moment.
Green Grounds have planted about 20 gardens.
We got 50 people in our wake-up papers, and they're all volunteers.
If you grow a child, when you grow carbon, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get any of them, if they're not shown, how food and body affected, they eat blind, whatever you're putting them in front of them.
I see young people who are trying to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids who are just on the path that they're looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
The gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to care for their communities to live a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to.
So that's one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole residential block in gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipping container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, you don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free shit because it's not sustainable.
The comet of sustainability is you have to keep them behind.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and getting them to experience the joy, pride and honor when you build your own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to make sure that we will become all ecological reborm, gangsters, gangmen.
We have to turn the image of the lamps.
If you're not a brush, you're not a gang.
You know, you're going to have to go and draw it in a straight line,
And let's have the weapon go for your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up in a kind of weird chairs and want to make a meeting where you're talking about doing some of the rules.
If you want to meet me, you come to your lawns, in my backyard, so we could plant some pork.
Love. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "nollygoll."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "nonollygoll" means "a-evolent politicians."
Although a newspaper publisher in the 19th century reared a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who claimed a lawless party, program or action, and his success of the power of the monumental probivial."
I have no idea what the workbox is.
I think something about it.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
Twenty-five1, for example, in the U.K. parliament, newspapers were not allowed to reveal the exact same word of debugging.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man who had an extraordinary name called Brrosby, who was working on parliament.
She threw it into the Tower of London, and he raped it, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to win, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so believe in bricks."
Brass Bendle is the English word for a tin.
But that's not true. It's going back to a leading advocate of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to America, at the time when it's just gone independence.
You're looking at the question of how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
What is the leader of an exclusive nation?
and there's been endless debate in Congress.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions for this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Governor Washington, and others, his senior George Washington, and again, proteitary protection of the people of the United States of America.
Not so sure.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was safe.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored in the room because this debate had three weeks to go.
I read the journal of a Senate that's always written, "I'm going to have the same issue."
The reason why the delay was and the boredom was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative hospital didn't want Washington to be a good job. They didn't want to.
The king, and maybe they're going to give it to ideas about their success.
They wanted to give him the most elusive, stupid, destest title that they could think of.
This title was "Sisember."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he just meant that someone was possessed by a meeting.
It's something like the pre-first of a jury.
He had no longer the size of the record "Dear" or "Dearch."
Sometimes, President had smaller colonial workers and government groups, but it was really unmanned title.
And so the Senate refused to stop it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to sign up the agreement and meet foreign officer.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of America?
And then after three weeks, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, you've been asked to use the "diction" in front of it, but they absolutely wanted to make sure they were not meant for their honest respect for the opinions and institutions, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, where it's the state of the state, not necessarily unwilling -- not necessarily unm necessarily assoviable, and the president of the people who are not committed to the person.
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One is -- and I think it's the best -- so far I can't figure out if the Senate ever had its name "atat" as a national president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just called it. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary -- you'll wait 223 years later.
And thirdly, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of the United States today sounds so humorous, isn't it?
It's something that has to do with a little over 5,000 nuclear swamps that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
The reality and the story has given the title.
And that's how the Senate ended up going.
You've got a respectable title.
And the other worry about the Senate, the sounds of self-interest, well, it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this, like the guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate, the Senate and the representative house lost, because nobody feels humbling when you're told that you're the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but actually change the reality much more much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebellion to the war of the junalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would sit on my black Conconnate to a pair of brown leatheres and a rocket in the direction of the government market, which I could not even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I'd been at the war a long time before, but besides the Sjama Party and football game at Samsenies and Rebel fought with racist-state groups and interference demonstrations that never lived with communism and Afghanistan and Afghanistan and Randvainvements before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm thinking, I've created Afghans, South nations, of God's Gnaden. A utopian and a radically political artist who's been working in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
Well, there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainworms. I want to make art mixed together and demanding the personality and trustes and re-creating and the reality and even using a kind of imaginative citizen to try and figure out the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- west, jihad against communist, which is a term of Bling, and use armed religious fear and political corruption to enrich itself.
And what else can jihad be doing when it's for Parliament to run and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Please choose me, I'm doing jihad and I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi who are spending as a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, which is why, a project called "Rearing" where you're a cop, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes from them, provide money and delivered to the names of Kabul, and they hope that they would take 100 percent of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the Cropior conflict.
The war and the strange views that came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bomber, where I created a shelter from local Afghan dressing, or even several or more in-tested or outdoor equipment into a bi-necene-death.
And I'd like to see how a simple shuffle of Kabul looked from 1899 to create a dialogue about the current development organizations of their origins in the past colonial rhetoric about the white man to protect the brown man behind himself and maybe even a little bit of a civil.
But for all of these things, you can go to jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your one?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been working as a model.
It's been said 10 years ago.
I felt like I was now building in this room a kind of unconditional tension, because I wouldn't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I've got some more time to change.
This is the first time someone is raising on the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness, I think.
If a few women really caught up when I came out, you don't need to tell me that I was reading on Twitter later.
I also recognize that I'm pretty privileged because I can change what you think of in very short 10 seconds.
I don't think that's the opportunity to do that.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me up, you're not doing anything as long as it's above my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this image.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I've just changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I'd never really have a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I could throw my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong ones I'd spent two days trying to do this, there are very few ways to change our utteration, and our utteration, even though it's super-simport, it's very irrelevant -- a huge impact on our lives.
I'm afraid to be honest with fear.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman, and in my business, we call this an sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, how do you make a model?
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that means nothing.
The real reason that I became a model is a major asset in genetic lottery and a great heritage, and maybe ask yourself what that legacy is.
Now, in the past few centuries, we've been not only defined beauty as healthy and primitive and symmetrical, in which admiration is bioengineered, but also as big, crusty, feminine and bright.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point. And maybe some fashionisters call up, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smink.
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU had all the modules that were on the run, each one that was being replicated, and that 677 parts were not only 61 percent.
The next question that's always being asked me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to this little girl is, why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja psychotic speaker, which would be completely miscoged, because if you were the first one."
When they're still saying about this great trade line, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "I'm going to call my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head-reemed of American birdry or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meis.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like you'd say you want to win the Jackor in the lottery.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
I'm going to show you 10 years of a Ph.D. model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be disintegrated.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a picture in the run," now, the leg goes up, beautiful and long, and so long, this arm, back to the back, is on the side of the head, and you move back in the middle of the day, and just go back and you see it back, you see it, 300, 300,
It looks something like this.
I hope that I'm less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's happened.
If you finish school and you've done a life cycle and you've done a few jobs, you can't tell much more, and if you say that you want to be president of the United States, but in life, "Have years of underwear," you'll be considered weird.
The next question that's been asked to me is, "Who is going to revive all the photos?"
And yes, so much of the photos are retured, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photograph I've done, and that was the very first time I'd had a Bikini. I didn't even have my period.
I know this is going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
I was just seeing it in my grandmother a few months ago.
This is me the day of the launch.
My friend had to come and join me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a Hollywood bird.
This is me with the football team and at the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you see that these images are not pictures of me.
They're constructed, and they're constructed by a group of professionals, Hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the post-processs. They're not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You're going to have things for free?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-foot-cuffers that I can never wear, except the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money. And you gave me the dress for free.
I was a teenager, and I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was going over and she was going to stop a red light, and of course it was stopped. It just took one: "Por, Mr. Woote, and we could go on.
I got these zero things because of my appearance and not because of my personality and there are people who are paying for their appearance and not because of their personality, they're paying a great price.
I live in New York, and from the 140 teenagers who have been stopped last year and shot, 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 177 young, male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Am I stopping?"
He said, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When am I going to quit?"
I found my research on this talk, and I found that 53 percent of all-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up at 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question I've ever asked myself is, "What is it that it's like to be a model?"
And I think they'll expect that answer, "If you're a little bit thinnerish, and you're going to have glowing hair, you feel very happy and fabulously."
And we give backloads an answer that might give that impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel as much as it's great, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because we never say what I'd never said before the camera, is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "I'd be happier if I had thin legs and shiny hair?"
And then you'd meet some modules, because they have the thin legs and the most gloomy hair and the most cool hay flam, and they're because of their appearance, probably, the most insecure women on the planet.
And when I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to move an honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to put myself up here and say, "I got all the benefits from one of the stack that was being dragged into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good enough to rearrange, and that's not always going to make me happy."
It was especially difficult to put a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the biggest users of it.
But I'm also lucky, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've managed to get here 10 or 30 years since I've been left, and my career has been disrupted, because I probably wouldn't tell you how my first job was going to tell you how I'd paid college, which is so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk and you're going to hopefully realize that we all recognize the power of the image in our strange successes and failures.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, Laddafi's Resign. Give him a hug.
But never will be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been now almost two years since the Libyan revolution, inspired by the waves of mass incarceration in both the Tunisian and Egyptian revolution.
I connected myself to many other Libyans, and outside of Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and launch a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, grand-granddaughter women and men stood in the front row, demanded the end of the regime, held slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've demonstrated some examples of master courage by putting on the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong meaning of solidarity, from far from far from the far west, all the way into the South.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and nearly 50,000 deaths, we managed to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
But Gaddafi did not leave a huge burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for the change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrant regimes have destroyed both infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the ly-gian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I recognized how many other women re-creating civil society, and we demanded a public and a public-public transition to democracy and national acumen.
Near 200 organizations, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis, started in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybia, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops for the issues of capacity, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peace collection of Libyi women, a movement of women, leaders from different backgrounds, whose goal is to join the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to consider our right-sexual rights with democracy and peacebuilding.
In the recent election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and exclusion.
I was campaigning an initiative for the peacebuilding platform for women to become a nationalized law, a law that would give every citizen, no matter what context to choose, and to vote, and, especially to a political parties between men and female candidates on vertical and vertical-level and to set up a rule of money.
and we ended up being adopted and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the national bank worker in the first elections for 52 years.
But long, the euphoria of elections and the whole revolution, because every day we started to have new messages of violence.
One morning we entered the news about treasors of ancient mosques and Sufi sons.
Another morning, we got the message about the murder of American ambassador and the attack on the message.
Another morning, the wounded were signed from the armed forces.
And indeed, we are at the governing of the military and their ongoing values against human rights prisoners and their misdiagnairs of laws and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind preservation, polarized, moving from the ideals and principles, dignity, social justice that they had initially completed.
Intent, rejection and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our disclosing and the elections.
I'm actually here today to confess that we, as a nation, have made the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We've answered our priorities wrong.
Because the elections did not bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the hardest and change between women and men's leaders bring peace and national reconciliation?
No, it didn't.
So what's it then?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate the dominance of the dominance and the enduring of men and women as well?
Maybe the women were not the only one who missed it, but the female values of compassion, the gade and the seizure.
Our society needs a national dialogue and convergence when it took the elections that ultimately strengthen the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than she needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop doing the laws of anger and demanding a day of revenge.
We have to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gemade.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't only claim for the next values, but also to argue that router instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, instead of an intentional.
These are the ideals that need to be a war of razy laval to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has an alchemy and in this alchemy, it's about the cross-mistal of feminine and masking view.
That's the real punching.
And we have to do that in an existential way before we do sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam" -- "is the word of the Good God, Shig."
The word "raem" again, which is known in all the late-discovery traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rail" -- "in mother-in-law" and symbolizes the motherly feminine surrounding the whole humanity, the man of the man and the female, the tribes and all the peoples who have been out of them.
And just like the mother's mother, who grows in his embryo, he's completely free to feed the basic soul of the existence.
And so we said, "My God's going to give you all the things."
And so we said, "My Gade War was in front of my gritty."
Let's be the case of all the elo in the world.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up practicing the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all of this change-changing time.
At the age of seven, I saw a public execution for the first time, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer hungry myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter to my mother, and my sister of a colleague.
And she said, "If you were listening to this, our five family members are not going to be in this world anymore because we've been eating nothing anymore for two weeks.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly, I went over to the station and saw something very horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A squadiful woman was lying on the ground, and a pounding kid in her arm was smelling helplessly in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because they were all busy caring for themselves and their families.
The mid-9th century was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were crying for victims, and many others survived because they ate grass, beetles and forestocrine.
Occasionally, as we get older and more and more, the lights of the Amazon were dried at night, except for the lights of China on the other side of the beetle we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amhr, which is part of North Korea as a border between China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very profound and enabled by North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can tell that I was sent to the devastating years of famine to the relatives of the relatives of China.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take me 14 years to work together.
It was very hard in China to live as a young girl.
I had no idea what life would be like as a North Korean refugee. But soon I learned that it was not only extremely difficult but also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in an increasingly honest fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate.
One day, my biggest nightmare was recognized when I was caught up in the Chinese police and was sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be Northern Korean, so they tried my Chinese names and asked me a lot of questions.
I was so afraid of my heart to explode.
So, if anything was unnatural, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I'd made it my feelings and I'd answer the questions.
And after they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "That was a misguided.
She's not a Northoreist."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
North Koreans in China are looking at foreign messages called Asyl, but many of them are caught by Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released because of tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans did not have as much luck.
Every year, a lot of North Koreans in China are caught and rejected to North Korea, where they were tortured, or imprisoned in public.
Even though I was lucky enough to escape, there are not many other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard for survival.
and after they learn a new language and work, their world can be turned upside down in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was going to leave South Korea, and I was a bigger challenge than I thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea, that I had to start my third language.
I also saw the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've become very divergent, because of 67 years of the division.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstore?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't fall easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the first test.
Just as I became a new life-driven call, I got an shocking call.
The North Bronx government started taking the money that I was sending my family, and as punishment, my family forced to relinate to a remote place on the country.
They had to escape as fast as possible, so I started planning for flight.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to their freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself on the way to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese; I had to run them to more than 2,000 miles across China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we got almost several times.
One time, when the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the speculation of everyone, and he started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I decided to be a dog, and told him that they were mufficient, and I was her bosses.
He looked at me strangely, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to get it all the way down to the rough edge, but I had to go out and pick up almost all my money to make the boundary with Laos's border.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal borderlock.
After I paid money and cashpay, my family had been released in a month, but only after that, my family was re-created, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest blessings of my life.
I'd done everything I could to defend my family to freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the South Bronx's first message.
I went and I went between the immigrant and the police department, trying to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to get back to cash or cash money.
I lost all my hope.
And the guy's voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is going to care.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without complaining, he went to a bank engine, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about the whole heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to help the North Bronx people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The former outsiders symbolized me a new hope that the North Koreans desperately need, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of international community as the hope of the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I was united again in southern Korea, but the freedom is just one step.
North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, learning, learning, practicing, job education and much more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside, because many of us still remain in contact with family workers, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would want to make hopeful North Koreans success with international support.
I'm sure you'll see even more successful North Koreans around the world, including at the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide it in a way, and he's going to give it away.
He's not greedy. He's not laughing at the color of the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he's trying to speak words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown has to be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has absolutely unknowable memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate fries, but he remembers the release of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, when the first episode of the teapleties tied to my arm and grandma birthday.
Don't stop it incredibly?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they often went over and wrong.
But what motivated my heart and my soul has empowered was that although it was the case, even though it wasn't considered a normal one, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- and it was extraordinary -- and it was extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "authorism," it's a complex dysfunction of the brain that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's a different set of individuality, and it's very different than Sam.
And the world's been finding every 20 minutes in a new person of autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing diseases in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was only three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And I realized, after a few months, he was different.
He was very, very angry.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me.
Remi lived and set up in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy on the tiniest things, like cars in a row of room, put the washing machine in and eating everything that was coming in.
And as I grew older, it became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the Frelty and the never ended hyperactivity, something really unique: an abusive and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had lied.
It's extraordinary.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we're different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could only tell you one thing about Remi and Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be remarkably.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody's got a gift. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The opportunity to scale, progress and change will die in the moment we try to be somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Doc Edgerton has filled with us with awe and curiosity, this photograph on a project of an apple and a half a year's life of air.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new engineering technology that's so fast that it can create time-motion footage of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are looking at the outside of our perspective, or without seeing an <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and turn it off in a billionth of a second -- these are several parts of the second -- I make a package of photons that is hardly a millimeter wide, and this photon pack, this project, moving at the speed of light, and as I said, a million times a normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photons pack, and you shoot it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's going on in slow motion?
So, this whole event.
So, think about this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanosis -- so long it takes the light to go back this track -- but I need to slow this video to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what's going on.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon dish that starts to move through and eventually break into the inside.
A part of the light comes outwards to the table, and you see that spread of waves.
A lot of photons eventually reach the cycle of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's streaming around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and you leave it back the same route, and you slow it back to the factor 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, one week? No, one year.
It would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little still-living photography?
You can see again, like the waves of the table, the Tomate and the wall in the background.
It's like having a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me that the nature would paint this picture, one photo, one by one, but of course our eye looks a distinct image.
But if you look at these Tomreets again, you'll see that when the lights are streaming over, the lights will keep it all back. It won't be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomrow is coming, and the light jumps around in your building for a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Cameroon, it might be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if an fruit is a stable, not to touch it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you're making a picture of a short-term radiation period, you're very little light, but we're putting a billion times faster than the shortest air age, so you're getting pretty much no light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon pack, and we're drawing this in a million times, and we're going to do it again with very clever synchrony synchrony, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make this Fem-up video that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what if it were a new superpower for a future superheroes, could be able to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to turn some light into the door.
It's going to be crushing into the space, and part of it is reflected back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use that more quadruly, the shaft of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left side, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is a soup of the wall, and we're going to shut down the lights on the door.
After our paper in theNature Communications department was published, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to chop up this light project and we're going to put it back into this wall, and this photons pack will be all in the direction, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup, which will break the light, and then reflect a part of the lights of the light and reflect a tiny fraction of the photons back into the camera, but it will be interesting in the end of the time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique capabilities.
It has a very good time-solving technology, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, because of that, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point of the distance is.
So, by taking a laser and putting a laser on, we can take a raw image that -- how do you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images and put them together and try to analyze the various light-pired patterns, then we can see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've also got a little bit to do before we can implement this in the lab, we could build cars that can avoid collisions, and see what's behind the curve, or we can look in dangerous levels of survivors, by bouncing light through the windows, or we can build finalcope, to see the body deep in Ok and Ko.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, that's very challenging, and that's really a wake-up call for scientists to think about Femto photographer, because a new visual procedure could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as a one-on-one scientist, even a scientist, has become an art that has become an art of the ultra-fifthsight photography, and I realized that all those gigabytes of data we're collecting every time we're using not just a new kind of scientific image. We can also create a new kind of camera with paint and shafts and paint and traceings, and we can just look at the wave of time.
But it's also going to happen in the same way.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're going to almost record our speed of light, weird effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly incredible.
The sequence of what's happening in the world is going to appear in the light-processing sequence, so by applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So, whether it's photography around, or building a new imaging tool for medicine or new forms since our invention, we have all been open and accessible to our website and hope that the "filders" will show us the creative and the research community that we should stop to step up to the megapow.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with our people.
We don't make every neighbor in the street so many teachings are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the last few years, and use things like stickers and scanners and circles.
The projects came from my questions, how much renting my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we divide our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the home, that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is reassured by the huge eelar that had been loved ones for hundreds of years, drunk and trauma, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever saw it, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are also the city with most abandoned parts of America.
I live near this house, and I thought, how can I get it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother, and her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I've felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it's given me clarity of the things that I've been interested in in in in life now.
But I'm very hard to keep this view of the day.
It's easy to lose your life in a way, and to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard and I wrote together a bridge of the gaps, "I die, I want to die," and everyone coming, a piece of chalk, thinking about their life and share their hopes in this public.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day was completely filled, and it grew and grew.
I'd like to share a few sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I wish I'd die, because I'm being sued for piracy."
"I'd like to die before I'd like to be a full-time talking about the International Crisis line."
"I wish I'd die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'd die before I'd like to plant a tree."
"I want to die before I'm going to live sub-verbal."
"I wish I'd die, I'd like to keep them in my arms."
"I wish I'd die." I want to be a chapcill."
"I'd like to die." I'd like to be myself."
It was neglected in a meaningful place, and the hopes and the dreams of the people brought me to laugh, to tears and to hate me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and obvious way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and remembering what we're most important as we grow and changing.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction kit and now became a set in countries like Kasakan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and others.
We've shown how much power we have when we have the opportunity to increase our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships with other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often held up on talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that preparation on death is one of the things that strengthening most of us.
The idea of death really illustrates our lives.
Our common places show the best that we are as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people can help us not only to create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in aggressive mathematics. I think it's a very special problem for anyone who's been involved in disgusting mathematics, that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today, I'm going to try and explain what I'm doing.
We know that dancing is one of the most human activity.
We are excited with the sight of the Danic ballet and ropes, as you'll see.
There's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities that can possibly have a basic signal that a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's first destroy this extraordinary ability, which also makes it my bosses, who was a ballet's mind.
Over the years, we've been doing a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, though, in the world, there are 6.3 million people suffering from this disease, and they have to live with the most disastable symptom of weaknesses, death, scarcity and other people who are living that causes that disease, and so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We have to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether or not there's cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that question.
Now, trouble is that, if you're in the face of Parkinson's disease and other movements, you don't have biomarkers, so you can't do easy blood analysis. The best thing that's there is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the clinic. It's very expensive, and that means that outside clinical trials will never be done.
But what if patients could do that test at home?
That would make a more prerequisite trip to the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have to be expensive to hospitals.
It's actually 300 percent of the time that it costs to look at the neurologic unit.
And so I want to propose to you a very unconventional way of trying to achieve that, because we're all, at least, virtual impenatives like mymit, Janppler.
So here you see a video of vibrating vocalgers.
This is what happens in the common state when someone's voice is creating. We can look at the coherent ballet dancers because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs when we make the sounds, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And you need a lot of practice like ballet.
Think about how long a child it takes to learn to speak.
By the way we click on the input, we can determine the position of vibrating vocalgers, and the limbs are also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
On the lower record, you can see an example of the irregular vocal evidence.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Bad, weakness, cphemality.
The language is even mourning and screaming, and that's an example of the character for it.
Now, this impacts on the voice may be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and the symptoms of the data combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, we can now find out where someone's in a spon between disease and health, just because of the voice.
So how can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're not herinvasive. The test was given to neurologists.
Not too small. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are accurate. They're not really involved in the right-reviewed.
So they can be done independently.
They're very quick, it's actually going to take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're extremely cheap, you can use it in a huge amount of detail.
So these amazing goals are what we can do now.
We can reduce logistics problems for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine interfaces in the hospital.
We can get objective data from shared observation.
We can do cheap mass recruitment for clinical trials for the first time, and we can do it in a very accurately available population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, and we're going to start Parkinson's dilemma.
With Aculab and patient TV, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data for the potential of these targets.
We have a call-bars-a-half-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with or without Parkinson's, can be called cheaply, to leave a few cents, and I'll be known to have had six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, say, do we want 10,000 people to ask who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happening is that the patient in the phone call must have to tell if that person has Parkinson's disease or not, OK.
Some of them may not be going to get to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in many different circumstances, which is interesting. Those conditions are important because we're wired to decide which ones are the actual markers for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is the same.
It's much better.
My students and Thanasis -- I have to give him the money because he's done such amazing work -- has shown that it works on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call that an improvement.
That means that people can call the phone with their phones and they can do the test. People could call them Parkinson's disease so they can send their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya, the southern tip of the Nairobi National Park.
You see my father's cows behind the back of my father and behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just wrapped in the south, and that means that wildlife animals can be vacated from the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and she found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we were together with our animals and the heavens, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I've only been learning lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our graves. They are also supported because of this problem.
They kill lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are not only as few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
I have a boy in my tribe between six and nine years old who are responsible for his father, and that's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Men fear of fire.
But then I realized that we wouldn't really help, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on going.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird, you look back and you go back. And the next time, they come, and they say, this thing doesn't move, it's still there.
and they grab our livestock.
One night, I was listening to the stall. I was walking around with a torch, and this time the lions didn't catch.
The lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working in my room as a little boy all day, and I even took the new radio back to my mother, and the day it brought me almost to the point. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a power-in-creating machine. It shows if you want to turn it to the right or the left. It's blinking.
And I turned on a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little puckle out of a broken bag lamp.
And then I built all of this together.
The solar panel generates the battery, the battery supplys electricity to the server. I call it a transformer.
And the power of the beetle is flashing.
You can see that the sins show outwards, because they come from there, lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights flashing and the lions believe I'm going to the rubble. I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our home, and since then, we've never had trouble with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights in. You can see the lion lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're actually doing pretty well.
My idea is now used in all Kenya, including for other predators like hymen or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helps by fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in together where there are no lights, and I'm showing the people how to use them.
A year ago, I was just a boy who was eating out of his father's cows, and I looked at planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of them."
And here I am.
I was invited to create an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to make the case. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and the lions. We can connect to each other, side with the lions, without any argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you're listening.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electric inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
So my next invention, now, is I working on an electric fence. An electroconceic?
Yeah, I know that electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want my own.
You've tried it once, right -- Yeah, I've tried this a little time, but I've been back to the trial because I got a blow.
The beginning is hard. Richard Turder, you're pretty special.
We're going to hire you each step of your walk, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but I'd like to share with you my 15 favorite pictures, and I've not just done one of them.
There was no kind of executive, no style, no chance of even drawing a picture. Not even in the first place that the lighting was being considered.
To be honest, most of them were shot from random tourist.
My story starts when I was in New York for a talk, and my wife made this picture, where I gave my daughter my first birthday to my arm, and we were at the corner of 57 and 5th.
Just a year later, we were back in New York, so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this is going on.
When my daughter's third birthday came, my wife said, "Hey, why do you not go to New York and do a father's first-daughter turn to continue the ritual?"
And we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're having a complete stranger with your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one's ever really left with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just one puncture moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to think about the time in October, and to change our time and how we're going to change our year, not just physically, but in everything.
Because as we always make the same image, our perspective changes as it moves to time. As it's reaching new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, as it's dealing with everything that it sees.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect every year.
In recent, as one of our trips, we went for a walk, and suddenly they'd come to the point of the line, it shows a red brand store in a dollhouse that they had learned as a little kid, at the time, in the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old, at this point.
She said that she remembered her heart from the chest when she first saw the store for nine years ago.
And now they look at high schools in New York because they really want to go to New York.
And I was struck by this. The most important thing we're all creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of an active role in conscious memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm hardly at very little a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage all of you today to come into the image and ask you not to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 25.56, 56.7/33.1/20.8/13.1 (BP=0.956, ration=0.957)
