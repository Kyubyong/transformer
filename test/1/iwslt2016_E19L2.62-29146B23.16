When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychotherapy patient.
I was a Ph.D. student in Berkeley who was a clinician.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
And when Alex came to the first session, she wore jeans and a bunch of popular top, and she fell on the couch in my office, and she was throwing out her sands and telling me she was there to talk about men's issues.
And when I heard that, I was relieved.
My classmates got a fireman when they first had a gang.
And I got a woman in the '20s who wanted to talk about boys.
I'll get that one. I thought I was.
But I didn't succeed,
With the funny stories that Alex brought to the meeting, it was easy for me to just nod your head while we were moving the problems in front of us.
"30 is the new 20," Alex and as far as I could think of it, it was right.
Work later, married afterwards, children later, even after that, died came later.
People in the 20s, like Alex, and I had nothing as a time.
But soon, my coach was urging me to question Alex's love life.
I stopped.
I said, "Yes, she's dealing with men under their level, she's asleep with a pamhead, but she's not going to marry him."
And then my lunchman said, "No, but maybe she was married to the next one.
And the best time to work on Alex's marriage is the one that, before she's married."
This is what psychologists call a "ha-ha moment."
That was the moment when I realized that 30 aren't the new 20.
Yes, people are leaving home home later than it used to be, but that was what Alex<unk>d<unk>d<unk>d<unk> not done for the creation.
This was what Alex's done 20th of the most optimistic development time, and we sat there and we gave them a little bit of time.
And it struck me that this kind of harmless neglect was a serious problem with real consequences, and that was, not only to Alex and her love lives, but to the crater, families and the prospects of all people in the '20s.
At this point in the United States, there are 50 million people in the 20s.
We're talking about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent, if you think that none of the adult age is reached without going through the 20,
So raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
I want to see a couple of you.
Oh, yeah! You're all amazing.
And when you work with someone in the '20s, you love one, because of you in the 20s, I want to see you -- O.D. -- that's great. People in the '20s really care.
My specialty is people in the '20s, because I believe that every one of those 50 million should know what psychologists know, neurologists and fruit disabilities, long ago, the challenge is one of the most basic and yet-truths that you can do for the work, for the love, for the happiness, perhaps for the world.
This is not my opinions. These are facts.
We know that 80 percent of the most exceptional moments, in time, are going to happen to 35.
That means that eight of 10 choices, experiences and vhaids, that are in your life, that are what it is until you're in the middle, you've already been 30.
If you're over 40 years old, you're not going to be panicked.
And I think this group will go well, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.
We know that at age 30, more than half of Americans are married or lived with the future partners or have a relationship.
We know that the brain is the second and last growing in the 20s, and wired for the adult age, which means that whatever you want to change on you is now the time we do.
We know that the personality changes more than the 20s, more often than in life, and that the fertility of women reach 28 is their peak, and that after 35 things will be complicated.
So in the 20s, you should be able to develop more and more about the body and the possibilities.
When we think about the evolution of a child, we all know that the first five years of speech-winning and bonding in the brain is critical.
It's the time when the ordinary, everyday life has a valid impact on the future.
But we hear little about it, and there's something like adults that we're doing in the world, and our 20s is a critical time to do it.
but people don't get to hear that in the 20s.
The press talks about the time transitioning of adulthood.
And scientists call the 20s a constant puberty.
And journalists think stupid nickname for people in the 20s, like "Twixters," or "mults" -- "my child."
That's true.
Now, as a culture, we have a trivialized, what's now the ultimate decade for adulthood.
And Leonard Bernstein said that great things are going to be done with a plan and a little bit of time.
I don't know?
So what happens when you're going to tattoo someone's head in the 20s and say, "You're going to get 10 years to make something out of your life?"
Nothing.
This person is the ambition, and the urgency of the urgency, and it's happening nothing.
And so every day, intelligent people come in the 20s, like you or your sons and daughters in my office, and they say something like, "I know, my friend doesn't do me well, but that relationship doesn't count. I'm just calling the time dead."
or they say, "All right, as long as I've done it for the age of 30 years, I've done my career to start, everything's fine."
But later, it sounds like this: "My 20s are nearly over and I have nothing to say.
I had a better life cycle when I was just completing college."
And then it sounds like this: "In my 20s, we've been a partner, like the trip to Jerusalem.
And everybody would sit around and have fun, but then at the age of 30, the music would suddenly go out and everybody would start hanging.
I didn't want to be the only one who stayed in the room. I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the next chair in my 30s."
Where are the people in the 20s here?
It's not power.
OK, it's easy to say, but it doesn't make any mistakes, because it's all about a lot.
If there's much of the 30s that have been transferred, there's a huge pressure, in the 30s, to start a career, to choose a city, to have a partner, a partner, two or three children in a much longer period.
Now, a lot of these things are inconsistent, and as research findings now show just effortlessly and stressful things all at once in the '30s.
The Post-of-life crisis doesn't mean buying a red sporting car.
It means you can't do the career you want to do.
And to remember that you can't have the child that you want, or the child can't give a sib.
Too many people in the '30s and 40s look at themselves and say to me and say about their 20s, "What was I doing? What was I thinking?
I want to change what people do in the 20s and think.
This is a story that shows how it's going.
It's the story of Emma.
Emma came to my office when she was 25, because she said she thought was a identity crisis.
She said she wanted to work in art, or she was in the Entertainment, but she had not decided that she had been pre-deathed in the last few years.
Because that was cheaper, she lived with her friend who was making more his temporal servant than his ambitions.
And although their 20s were hard, their years were much worse.
She was crying in the board often, but she gathered, and she said, "You can't choose your family, but your friends have."
One day, Emma came very angry and cried almost every hour.
She had bought an ad-doc's book, and she spent all morning signing their various contacts, but then she would stare up on the empty place that came after the words: "In the emergencyful ask, please."
She was almost hysterically, and she looked at me and said, "Who's going to be here for me if I have a car accident?
Who will feed me when I have cancer?"
The moment, I had to shake myself together to not say, "I."
But Emma didn't need a therapist who was really, really, really, to care about it.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was their chance.
I'd learned from my first patient Alex to too much to just see how emangleations of disgust in a way that was worthless in a good way.
So the next week and a couple of months, I gave Emma three advice that every 20-year-old who should hear if there was a man or a woman.
One, I told Emma that she had no identity crisis, that she was supposed to have a identity capital rather than a identity.
And I thought, you know, you should look for something that would keep them on.
Make it a difference for you, invest in something you want to be next.
I didn't know about Emma's professional runners, and nobody knows what the future of work looks like, but I know that identity capital generates capital.
So now is the time for this international job, this internship, this startup that they were trying to do.
I'm not cutting the adventures of the 20s, but the ones that don't count, by the way, are not even explorers.
This is Prokastalism.
I said to Emma, look at the work world, but do what you were doing.
The second thing I said is that urban acronym is overrated.
So good friends are prime to come to the airport, but 20, who are conflicted with people who think they're, limiting who they know, who they know, what they're thinking about, how they're talking, where they're working.
This new thing, this new person to advise, is mostly from outside its own site.
New things emerge like this. "Srust alliance," which is friends of friends.
It's true: half the top 20s is under the business or not at all.
But the other half of them are not, and they were making faint alliances in them.
Half the jobs have never been submitted, so when their boss is contacted with the use-seeds, she was not given a job.
This is not a fraud. That's how information spreads.
The last advice: Emma believed that you couldn't choose the family, but the friends.
And this stood right for her when she was growing up, but when she was 20, she soon would have a choice for her own family if she was founded a partner and a family.
I told her the time to choose a new family, well.
You might think it's better than the 30s, to settle up than the age of 20, or 25, and I agree with you.
But any of you who you're smelled or inhale in your life when everyone's married on Facebook is not progress.
The best time to plan your marriage is before you have one, and that means just as intentional in love as you're doing your work.
You want to check your family, and you want to know what you want, not because it works, or someone who's struggling with the time you've just chosen.
So what happened to Emma?
We went through her address book, and she found the villagers of a cousin who was working in another state in a museum.
This weak band helped her to get a job there.
This is a working message that gave her the reason to leave her friend who she lived with.
Now, five years later, it's an event designer for museums.
She married a man who she accepted her.
She loves her new career and her new family, and she sent me a card that said, "Now this is the line: "to case you're not big enough."
Emma's story sounds like everything is simple, but that's what I love about 20-year-old.
It's so simple to help them.
And then, 20 years old, like a forward map of planes just leaving the airport and going somewhere to the west.
And right after the launch, a little twist can make the difference if you land in Alaska or in Fiji.
And this is equally true for 21 or 25-year-old, a good conversation, a great vacation, a inspired TEDTalk, can have a huge impact over years and even beyond the coming generation.
This is an idea that should reach all the 20s that you know.
It's just as simple as what I said to Alex.
I have the privilege of talking to these 20 Americans like Emma every day: The 30s are not the new 20s, so you're making your own identity capital, using your weak band to find your family.
You're not supposed to know what you don't know or didn't.
You're deciding your life right now.
Thank you.
Throughout the computer history, it was always our target, to reduce the distance between ourselves and digital information, to bridge the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen where we can actually experience our imagination.
And that distance has grown smaller, smaller and smaller and smaller, and now it's smaller than a millimeter, the thickness of a trachet, and computers have been accessible to each.
But I wondered what it would be like if there was no boundary at all.
I imagined what this would look like.
So first, I developed this tool that's in the digital world, so if you press strong on the screen, it's turning the physical character to pixel.
Designers can use their ideas to very easily materialize in three-material, and surgeons can train virtual organ under the screen.
So this was a tool that was ripped through the border.
But our hands still remain outside the screen.
How do we go in and interact with the digital information and apply the full wholeness of our hands?
In Microsoft Applied Sciences, I, along with my mentor Cati Boulanger, who's a computer-developing and a small room about the keyboard to operate in a digital workplace.
So it's because a transparent screen and deep cameras are combined to the invention of the fingers and the face, you can now lift your hands up from the keyboard, reach the 3D space and touch the pixel with the blind hands.
And there's a window and a date position in the actual space, and you can choose it as easily as to grab a book from a shelf.
And then you can flip through this book and tag lines and words, all of this on the virtual touchpad underneath every window.
Architects, in fact, can use their models to roll directly with both of their hands and rotate them.
So in these two examples, we are reaching into the digital world.
But how about turning the whole thing back and seeing the digital information instead?
I'm sure many of you have already experienced the experience of buying papers online and returning back to it.
But now you don't have to worry about it.
Here's another "online"-realite closed-up.
This view is given by a walletronic or a transparent display when the system understands the geometry of our body.
And that whole idea, I began to think about it, not only to see the pixels in the room, but to make them physically, so that we can touch it and feel it.
What would it look like?
In the MIT Media Lab, with my mentor, Ishii, and my collaborator, Rabei Post, made a real pixel.
Now, in this case, this circular magnet acts like a three-dimensional pixel in our world, which means that both computers and humans can move around this object, at least within this little 3D space.
We've measured effect that we've switched gravity off, and we've control the movement by combining magnetic levitation, mechanical drive, and we're able to combine these protons.
By programming the object digitally, we free it off of the constraints and the time, by allowing human movements to now be reintroduced and left in the real world.
For example, Choreographic can be taught over long distances, or Michael Jordan can be reunited again and thrown back into the real world.
So students can use this to learn complex concepts like planetary motion and physics, and unlike computer screen TV or text books, it's this real and physical experience that you can touch and feel powerful, and it's very powerful.
And more exciting than what we currently have in the computer right now, it's too complex to imagine how programming the world is going to change our daily activities.
As you can tell, digital information will not only show us something, but start interacting directly with us as part of our physical environment without separating ourselves from our real world.
Today, we started talking about the limits, but when we remove this line, the only frontier is our imagination.
Thank you.
I've been trained for two years to become a turnerin in Hunan, China in the 1970s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to send me to a school for athletes, all the cost was paid.
But my mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like her.
After they survived the Cultural Revolution, they realized that the only way to happiness was a safe and well-paid job.
It's not important whether I like the job or not.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
This is me playing on my imaginary piano.
A legendist, very early on, has to start with acrobatics, so I tried everything to go to the opera school.
I even wrote the guilty directors, and the host of a wheel file.
But the adults didn't like my idea.
And the adults didn't think it was serious to me.
Only my friends supported me, but they were also only children, just as meaningless as myself.
And at the age of 15, I knew that I was too old to start with the training.
So my dream would never be seen.
I was afraid of the rest of my life that I was only able to give a lucky second choice.
But that's not so unfair.
So I sat in my head thinking about another calling.
But no one there to teach me something? It's good.
So I asked books.
I used to keep my hunger with the same book on a writing writer and musician family. <unk>"Bry family of Fu Lei<unk> I found my role in an independent woman, while the Conclothian tradition of the Romanian school.<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"Jane<unk> So I learned from this book was too efficient. <unk>"<unk>" to learn to learn to me by 200,000 books cheaper.
<unk>"<unk>"Sanalal of entire"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"The Giles of history" by Nanaijin in 1995 I went to the United States. What books have I read first?
Of course, books that are banned in China.
The good Earth is about the family of Chinese farmers.
It just doesn't make you sound like propaganda. I understood.
The Bible is interesting, but it's weird.
But that's a theme for another time.
But the fifth commander got me a kind of a revelation: "Don't you honor your father and your mother."
"Your teach," I thought, "That's so different and much better than a rief."
And that was my way of freeing myself from the racist guilt and redefining the relationship with my parents.
And as I was encountering a new culture, I started reading the comparative way.
This is what gives a lot of insights.
For example, I found this map not right at first because Chinese students grew up with this one.
It never occurred to me that China doesn't have to be in the middle of the world.
So a map tells something about the perspective of the personal.
This is not a new thing to do with reading.
In the academic world, it's a standard process.
There's even research areas like inter-course-related religious and comparison literature.
Compareance and conflict might allow a more complex understanding of a subject.
So I thought, well, if you think about reading in research, why not in everyday life?
And so I started reading two books at the same time.
They can act on people -- "Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson" -- John Adams," by David McCullough, who was involved in the same event, or by friends with common experiences.
We have to print 'C" by Katharine Graham's "War buffet" -- life is like a snowball" in Alice Schroeder. I had to have the same story in different genres -- "King-Jord" moments from "The King" by Christopher Moore" -- or different stories, different cultures, and different stories, in the ghintings of Joseph's "The Rabin" by Prince Rabin.
For Christ, the study of economic, political and spiritualism.
And in Buddha, they were all psychological things: lust, fear and social obligation -- interesting.
When you control a foreign language, it's fun to read the favorite books in two languages.
This is a sea bird, a mourliologist by Thomas Merton. The life cycle of the Taoism, from Alan Watts<unk> instead of losing me in translation, I found how much I can gain.
So, in translation, for example, I've realized that "happiness" means literally "beep" in Chinese, "Wait joy. Hearch!
Ove. We've got to speak in Chinese, literally "nees Mum Mother." Ohh.
Books for me are like a magical gate. By having me a connection with the people of the past and the present.
I know that I'm never going to be lonely or uncomfortable.
A broken dream is really nothing compared to what many others have gone through.
I've come to believe that it's not the only purpose of a dream to be true.
And his most important purpose is to get you to touch with the touch of where dreams came from, where our passion and our happiness came from.
Even a broken dream can make that purpose.
And I'm here today, because of books, happy, with a purpose in life, and with clear vision, most of my time.
You know, it's always like your books.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came to class, and she was so impressive, just as new girls seemed to be always.
She had long-caster hair, and a little cute little typdles, was good at geography and in the book.
And that year, I was in front of Eifers, until I was completing a joint-fane plan.
So one day I stayed in school for a little longer, much longer, and I stayed hiding in the girls' school.
When the air was in, I came to the classroom, I was staring at the classroom and I was signing the textbook from the teacher.
And then I did.
I was manipulating my skirt's notes, just something, just a few more.
All right.
When I wanted to go back the book, I noticed some of my other classes had pretty good grades.
So I applied in the Eifler's vets, I applied all the notes, all without my imagination.
I gave all the four and myself a mailing because I was also there all the time.
I'm still a little bit over my behavior.
I don't understand where this thought came from.
I don't understand why I felt so good about it.
I felt good.
I don't understand why I was never punished for it.
It was so obvious.
I never got caught.
But most of my confusion, why was it so much wrong that this little girl was so good at the back of the book?
Eifers kind of astonished me.
It's so mysterious, so profound.
We know that babies suffer under eifers.
And also, just like primates. Sulter of natural beings are very vulnerable to this.
We know that eifers are the main cause of homicide among murder in America.
But I've never read a study that could explain me their loneliness, their longevity, or their macro-spanial nerve.
And for that, we need to turn to the literature, because the novel is the lab where the eifler was analyzed in all sorts of different forms.
Is it a exaggeration to say that if we didn't have a rush, we would not have a literature?
So no unjustent Helena, no "Odys Sea."
You're not supposed to be a pit of a king, not a hundred1 night-to-seight-seight-seight."
No Shakespeare.
And the readingists in the U.S. Senate, because we're losing "Dong and delusion," the great "Gatsby," "Fiesta," "Madame Bovary," "Anna Karin."
No serifers, no preference. I know it's gotten into fashion to say that Proust has the answer to everything, but in terms of an impersono, it really did.
This year, we're celebrating the 200th anniversary of his masterpiece, "The Trime of the lost time," and its systematic analysis of sexual acalousy and the regular rule, my thing, that we can have hope.
Let's think about Proust, we think of emotion, right?
We're thinking about the little boys trying to sleep.
We think of a piece of cake in Lavendel-Tee.
We forget how it was to his vision.
We forget how it's unconditional.
These are books in Virginia Woolf, just as delicately as a katzress.
I don't know what's really a katzarm, but let's say it's impressive.
Let's look at why the novel and the eifler, the eifler, both so well, fits with Prousty.
Is it so obvious that eifers are diminished, reduce from person -- desires, barrier, such a strong basis for a story?
I don't know. I think it's just hard to get the pain line, because think what happens when we're more ephemous.
If we're a little bit out of the closet, let's tell a story.
It's telling us stories about the lives of other people, and they make it bad for us to be comfortable because they're designed to make us bad.
As a narrator of history and the audience know what details they have to contain to hit the knife in the ribs. Right?
Eifers makes all of us amateur engineers, and so Prousty knew it.
The first band, "In Swann's world," in the novel poet, Swann, who's one of the protagonists, thinks very, very loving about his laughter, and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a couple of sentences, they're so long as they're pouring around, and he's going to be aware, "Wait, whatever else I love with this woman.
Everything that she gives me, and what gives me joy, could even be enjoying somebody else's joy, even at that moment."
This is the story he's talking about, and about the time he writes about Proust, that Swann, every new rifle he discovered in his bowl, lies on his "Infinement" in his private bedroom.
We have to admit that Swann and Proust are notoriously jealous.
Prousty's friends would have to leave the country if they wanted to end with him.
But you don't have to be more susceptible to setting up the fact that it's hard work. Right?
Eifers is a tiring.
It's a hungry feeling that's needed to be.
What does the eifers like?
It's a lot of information that's known by eifers.
It's a little bit like the noise.
Eifers may have long-lopping hair and little cute little letters.
Eifers might like photos.
And that's why instagram is equally successful.
Basically, Proust is linked to the language of science and the eifers.
When Swann's experience this ecstasy, suddenly he starts listening to the door and the servant of his shepherd's staff defies, defending his behavior.
He says, "You may think that's repulsive, but it's not more so others to interpret an ancient text or to look at a memorial."
He says, "There's been scientific research on real intellectual value."
Prousty tries to show us that eifler is intolerable and makes us look silly, but in its core, it's a search for knowledge, after truth, painful truth, and in terms of prehistoric, the more painful, the better.
Cults, humiliation, loss -- that's for preference for wisdom.
He says, "A woman we need to suffer from that can shatter us a larger and wider range of emotions than the genius of a man who care about us."
Does it mean that we should look for the cruel women?
No. I think he's trying to tell us that eifler's going to tell us something about ourselves.
Is there another emotion that makes us open in this particular way?
Does anything else express us aggression, our hidden ambition and our persever?
Are we thinking about any other kind of weird intensity?
Freud should later write about it.
And one day, Freud was consumed by a very, very talented young man who was consumed by the idea that he deceased his wife.
And Freud says, this man is kind of weird, because he doesn't even look at what his wife does.
Because she's innocent, and everyone knows that.
The poor creature is clearly underweight.
Instead, he looks at things that his wife doesn't realize, does, which is, in other words, inconsistent behavior.
Do you cry too much or if it's randomly bumping up with a man?
"Ffriend" says that the man is going to be the cap of the unconscious mind of his wife.
The novel is very good at this point.
The novel is very good at how eifers are attracted to us, but not looking straight.
Because the more jealious we are, the more we put it on to fantasies.
So I think that jeifers are not going to do us to do violent or illegal things.
And eifers cause us to become really, really creative.
And I think about it at age eight, but I also think about the story that I've heard in the news.
A five-year-old woman from Michigan was arrested because she wrote a fake Facebook account for a year, a terrible news written on her own.
A whole year.
She tried to push her wedding friend's friend in her shoes, and I admit when I heard that, I responded to wonder.
Because -- let's face it.
What's more enormous, even though it's corructed, creativity. Right?
This is something from a novel.
This is from a novel by Patricia Highde.
And high-definition is one of my favorite writers.
It's the most brilliant and weird woman of American literature.
From her is "Bwo strangers in the train," and "The talented Mr. Ripley," all the books that are about it, how Eifler -- they're confused in our minds, and we're in the sphere of the Eagle, in the realm of the compartment, between the membrane and what might be -- in a moment, it can be harvested.
Take Tom Ripley, the most famous figure.
First, Tom Ripley wants to be you and have what you have, and then you have what you once have, and you're like the ground. He's gone off the floor. He's responding to your name, he's wearing your jewelry, he's in charge.
That's a method.
But what are we going to do? We can't do it like Tom Ripley.
I can't give the whole of four, even if I'd like to do it in some days.
It's a shame, because we live in a kind of neduous time.
We live in a "manal-induced-lipped era."
Now, we're all good citizens of social media, where the currency is neid. Right?
Are we afraid of the novel of the road? I'm not sure.
But if we do what characters do, if they're not sure, if they're in the possession of a puzzle.
If you go to 221Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes.
Think about the people at Holmes, think of his Nemesis as a professor Moriarty, this genius criminal.
But I always liked "Inspector's trade," the head of the Arab Yard with a rat, the Holmes, needs the Holmes genius, but it shers him.
I'm so familiar with that.
So, the point of trade needs your help, it sheds it, and it fills it over the course of the story,
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually, in the 6 Napoleon, comes in and it all came in, and it's shocking with its solution, TTT's going to Holmes around and says, "We're not neclist at you, Mr. Holes.
We're proud of you."
And he adds it up to the fact that there's no one in Scotland called Yard who didn't want to shake the Sherlock Holmes.
This is one of the few times that we see Holmes in his story, and I find this little scene very moving, but also mysterious. Right?
It seems like eifler's not an emotional, it's a physical problem.
There's a moment in time that Holmes are about a different wave of wavelengths like cruise.
And then, in the next moment, they're on a wavelength.
And suddenly, it's just time to admire the wisdom that he's prevented that he was talking about before.
Is it really so easy?
What if jealousy was just a physical problem? If it was just about how we were going to hide with the other person?
Maybe we wouldn't treat somebody's or anything that's normal.
We could go in and we could.
But I like emergency plans.
While we're waiting for it, we still have the literature as comfort.
Literally, the judges were hunted.
Literally, it can dilate itself, it invites itself.
And then, there's anything there: the good trade, the terrifying Tom Ripley, the crazy swann, Marcel Prousty himself.
We are in an integral society.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I was on a camping trip with my father in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness of the northern part of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest was cool.
The sun made the leaves look like a color-like glass, and if there was no path, you would have almost likely likely likely likely to assume that we were the first people to go through that forest.
We went to our tent.
I looked at the little hut on a cliff, and I looked over a crystallic black, beautiful lake when something horrible happened to me.
The back of the roof was a trash cliff, maybe four square meters, with apple bats, combined aluminum foam and an old sneaker.
I was amazed, and I was angry and confused.
The tents were too lazy to kill away what they'd made -- who thought, would they fit after them?
The question stayed with me, and I generalized it.
Does it ever happen for us?
How do you turn it, or where the "uny" might be, who's behind us in Istanbul?
Who in the room behind us in Rio? Or in Paris or in London?
In New York, the stadiumi spends about 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recycling sticks every day.
I wanted to know them -- as individuals.
I wanted to understand who the job is.
What is it like to wear a uniform and to carry that kind of burden?
So I started a research project with them.
I went to the truck, I walked down the roups, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city. I learned a lot, but I was still a outsider.
I had to go deeper.
So I took a job as a pure power.
I was not only riding the truck. I was driving the truck.
And I used the mechanical doublet, and I was drinking the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege, and it was a very exciting experience.
Everybody asks for the smell.
It's here, but not pretending as you think, and in days when it's really bad, you're very used very fast.
and the weight is used to weight, it's just hard to do.
I know people who did this job for several years, and the other body of ordinary people still had the weight they put on their body, tons of waste every week.
And then there's the danger.
After the CCSE, the profession of the city district, under the top 10 most dangerous jobs in the country, and I learned why.
You're on the road all day long, all the way over.
Everybody wants to over and often don't want the car drivers enough.
It's really bad for the workers.
And the waste itself is full of toxins dropping off the trash cart and making terrible stuff.
I also learned about the indescension of the trash.
If you come from the board canopy and you see a city of the freeway, you'll notice that garbage is like a natural force itself.
It doesn't listen to making sense of it.
It's also kind of like the breathing or the circulation.
It has to be in motion.
And then there's the stigma.
You lay up the uniform, and you're going to be invisible until someone else -- whatever reason -- angry, because you're blocking the traffic with the car or taking a break close to your apartment or drinking a coffee in your local, and you come in and you're going to tell you they don't want one near them.
I find this stigma particularly ironic, because I believe that the care worker of the stadium is the most important workforce in the city's streets. That's three reasons.
They're the guardian of public health.
If they didn't remove the waste every day, and they're effective and effective, it would hurt the banic, and the more connected threats would threaten us in a very, very smooth way.
We've been talking about diseases that we've been in control for decades and centuries, and we're going to spread and harm ourselves.
The economy needs it.
If we can't throw out the old stuff, we don't have a place for the new ones. The motors of the economy start to fade when the consumer is closed.
I didn't evaluate capitalism, I just write out the rules of leadership.
And then there's what I call our average, everyday speed.
And I'm just talking about how fast we are used to motion these days.
We don't take care of our coffee cake, our bag, or our water bottle, clean it, or to hide or to tinker.
We take them, we throw them away, we forget them, because we know there are people on the other side who care about it.
And so today, I want to propose a few ways of thinking about the sports attitude to improve the stigma and bring them into this conversation about how to create a city that is sustainably and human.
So, you know, your work, I think, is kind of a crisquishical.
You see the streets every day, regularly.
They carry uniforms in many cities.
You know when you can expect them.
And their work is what we do.
They're like a back insurance.
The process that sustains us makes sure of ourselves, before our rejection, the unification, and the process has to keep constant, to keep every price.
And on the day of September 11, 2001, I heard the thunder of a dump on the street, and my little son and ran down the stairs and there was a man walking off his paper recycling route, and he was doing every Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him for his work, that day on day every day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me, and he's just going, and he's just going, "Everything's going to be good"
"Everything's fine."
And it was only later that I started my research on the stadium, and I found the man again.
His name is Paulie, and we used to work together a lot, and eventually we became good friends.
I wanted Paulie to be right.
Everything will be good.
But in our efforts to change the way we exist on this planet as a species, we also need to consider all the costs, including the very human cost of work.
And we've got to be informed to reach the people who are doing this work, to gather their experience, to think about how we can develop our systems to sustainability that will solve us from street recycling, which is a remarkable success in the last 40 years, across the United States of America and the world, and we're bringing us to a horizon where we can look at other species of waste, and we can see the structural sources of the industrial production.
The urban waste that we think about when we talk about waste is three percent of the national waste waste waste.
It's a remarkable statistic.
In your day-to-day life, when you see someone next time you see their job, you're going to clean you up, take a moment to perceive it.
So, take a moment and say thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what's going on?
That's enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what's going on?
My name is Mayso Zayid, and I'm not drunk, but the doctor was already in my birth.
He cut my mother six times in six different directions, and he grabbed me with poor little bits of air.
And that's why I have infantile cerebral palsy, which means I'm going to add all the time.
Look at a moment.
It's work. I'm a crossroads from Shakira, Shakira and Muhammad Ali.
Poor pals are not genetically genetic.
It's not a birtale. You can't get it.
Nobody has the uterus of my mother, and I didn't get it, because my parents are first degree, which they are.
They only get them through accidents, like the one that happened on my birth day.
I have to warn you. I'm not a source of inspiration, and I don't want anybody here with me because you all have a moment in your life to dream about being free.
Hold on for a moment.
It's a straight-up curse. It's a circle in the mall, it's a tube, it's a place where you look for a parking lot, and what do you see?
Fifteen empty disabled spaces.
And you think, "Well, why can't I be a little disabled?"
I have to tell you, I have 99 problems and cerebral palsy is just one of them.
If there was an Olympic canal of oppression, I would give a gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian, Muslim, female, disabled, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better now, I don't know.
Cliff Park in New Jersey is my hometown.
I love the fact that my inmates and my neighborhood have the same initial dream.
I also love the fact that I could walk from my house to New York City if I wanted to.
A lot of people didn't walk in C.D. but my parents didn't believe in a "mah."
The mantra of my father was, "Yes, you can do this! You can."
So when my three older sisters mixed, I mix.
When my three older sisters went to a public school, my parents would quit the school system so that I could go and go, and if we didn't all go through a dead, we would all take a stabry to my mother.
My father took me the running when I was five, put my heel on his feet and just sat around.
Another one of his tactics was to let a dollar bill in front of my nose so I could start it.
My inner Starrress was very strong, and as -- yes. So the first day I was in kindergarten, I was walking like a Champion who had too much to get.
There was only six Arabs in my town, and all my family were all.
Today, we have 20 Arabs in the city, and they're still all my family.
I don't think anyone has ever noticed that we're not Italian.
This was before 9<unk>11, and before politicians thought it was appropriate, I hate to use Muslims as a competition motto.
The people I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
But they were also worried that I could starve to Ramadan.
I told them that I could live from my body, three months, so it was a cooling check from sunrise to -- to a child's play.
I've been running on Broadway.
Yes, on Broadway. Total crazy.
My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned how to dance on the barrier, so I can walk on the dial.
And I'm from Jersey, where it's really important to be chic, so if my friend's orders were wearing traces, I'm also.
And when my friends spend their summermen on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't.
I spent my summer in a war field because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back every single summer to Palestine, one day Madonna will be like Madonna.
The summer row often passed out that my father wanted to cure me, so I had to drink milk from the deer, and was dejected to the Dead Sea, and I still know how the water was beating in the eye, and I thought, "It works! It works!
But one miracle lesson we found: yoga.
I have to say it's really boring, but before I was yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who can't even stand.
Now I can stand on my head.
My parents always thought that I was capable of anything that was impossible, and my dream was to play with the soap opera, "Genital Hospital."
And I was given a great grant to the ASU State University, because I would argue that every minority.
I was sort of the houseguard of the actress.
Everybody liked me.
I did my maths all the homework that wasn't so smart kids, got into all my classes, got into all of my teens.
And every time I played a scene from "The Glasmenie," my teacher cries my teachers.
But I never got a role.
So in my year, the ASU, eventually, was going to roll a piece called "You're dancing in Jackson."
A piece about a girl with C.
I was a girl with C.
So I tried everywhere, "I'm going to get a role!
I have cerebral palsy!
Finally, free! Finally!
Thank you, I'm finally free."
I didn't get the role.
Sherry Brown got the role.
I was a local officer in the head of the actress, I was crying hysterically, as if someone shot my cat, and she asked me why. She told me I was not able to do the stunts.
I said, "Excuse me, but if I can't do the stunts, the character can't do it."
I was actually born for that role, and they gave an actress without C.
College memorizes life.
Hollywood was more familiar with making physical actors physically disabled.
I went home after the end, and my first role was statistics as a soap opera.
My dream became true.
And I knew that I was about to get to the restaurant frergy, and I was going to be the gay friend.
But instead, I stayed a glamorized furniture that was only visible in the back of the head, and I realized that Casting-Aidan engineers did not make a flawy, ethnic, disabled actor.
They just put perfect people in their head.
But the exceptions are the rules, yes.
I grew up with the Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr and Ellen, and all these women had one thing in common: They were comets.
So I became a comicist.
My first job was to drive famous comedy from New York City to Shows in New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comber I ever went, when he realized that he was on the street in New Jersey with a girl with a driver.
I've come across the United States, and I've also done shows in the Middle East of Arabic, and I've been unaware and unfamiliar.
Some people say I'm the first comrist in the Arab world.
I don't like to call myself the first, but I know they've never heard of the evil clichy of women aren't funny, and they're so weird to us.
In 2003, my brother began from another mother and father, Dean Obeidallah, and I started with the New York Arabic comedy festival, which is now celebrating his 10-year-old.
Our goal was to change the negative view of American Arab politics in media, and also to remind Casting-colorists that South Asia and Arabia are not synonymous.
The popularity of Arabs was much, much easier than the challenge to get against the stigma of the disability.
My big breakthrough was 2010.
I was invited to the news show at Keith Olberman.
I came in and I was dressed in a high school dance, and she drew me in a studio, and I sat down to a magic chair.
So I looked at the stage manager and said, "Excuse me, can I get another chair?"
And she looked at me and she said, "Free, four, three, two ...
And we were live!
So I had to hold myself at the table of the host, so I couldn't roll up the screen during the scene, and when the interview was over, I was out of it.
And then my chance was, and I had it, and I knew I had never to invite me again.
But Mr. Olberman invited me not only one time, but was making me a full-time staff and stuck my chair.
And I was learning to work with Keith Olberman, and I learned something great: All the people on the Internet are three-wheels.
People say children are cruel, but as a child, or as adults, no one's ever done fun with me.
In the World Wide Web, I'm suddenly a gamewild with my disability.
When I look online videos, I see comments like, "Ey, why are they so?"
"Well, is that nuts?"
And my favorite: "Armer hens-shord-sherrist.
Did it have a disease?
We should pray for them."
And one of the things that struck me was to record my disability in Culits, a Screwwriter, a comic, a cerebral palsy.
A disability is as visible as the outside.
If a wheelchair driver can't play Beyonc<unk>, Sheyonc<unk>s can't play a wheelchair driver too.
The disabled are the biggest ones -- yes. It's worth a round. Go.
Now, with disabilities, people who are the biggest minority in the world, and we are the understated among the subject in the entertainment industry.
The doctors said, I can't walk, but I'm sitting here in front of you.
But if I grew up in social media, I wouldn't be here.
And I hope that we can do a positive picture of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe there might be less hatred on the Internet than there might be more positive role models.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it still takes a village to raise a child well.
And my journey with moving has brought me to some very special places.
I was allowed to run on the red carpet next to soap-touch-Star, Susan Lucci and the iconque Lorine Arbus.
I was invited to play a film with Adam Sandler and work with my idol, who was a wonderful Dave Matthews.
I was a leader of the Comedy Talk "Arabs Gone Wild" to travel around the world.
I was representative of the great state of New Jersey in the Democratic Comdown of 2008.
I founded Maya's kids, a charity, who's trying to give Palestinian refugee children the fraction of a chance my parents gave me.
But the moment that most of us are -- before this one -- the moment most came out, the most people I met was when I was flying in front of the man's belly and looking like a butterfly, and just like a bee who's on Parkinson's disease, and just like me, Muhammad.
That was the only time my father ever saw a live account of me, and I kept this talk on him.
: God, if you're a cited father, Dad. My name is Mayon Zayid, if I can, you can too."
There was a time when we solve big problems.
On July 21, in 1969, Buzz Aldrin climbed out of the Mola's Tower, Apollo 11 and went down to the sea of the rest.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the gray moon is the culmination of a persistent, collective.
The Apollo program was the largest peacebuilding in the history of America.
And to get to the moon, NASA has invested about 180 billion dollars according to the value of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo's work created for 400,000 people, and it took the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government.
People died, including the Fort 1 of the Apollo 1.
But all the way to the end of the Apollo program, 24 people flew to the moon.
From the 12s that were heading out of the surface, Aldrin, after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the oldest.
But why did they go?
They didn't bring much back: 380 kilograms of old rock, and something that every 24 later did -- a new sense of what our common homes are small and fragile.
Why did they go? Zynynynyn, they went, because President Kennedy wanted to show that his nation had better rockets.
But Kennedys's own words from 1962 at the Rice University are making a better sign.
For the time, Apollo was not just a victory of the West over the east of the Cold War.
At that time, the most powerful feeling of the amazement of the supernatural forces of technology.
They flew to the moon because it was something big.
The moonland happened in front of a long series of technological fumping.
About half of the 20th century, the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and a vaccine against tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, polio and smallpox were eradicated.
And technology seemed to have something to itself, which is what Alvin Toffler 1970s called a "fiction-lipping"
For most human history, we couldn't move faster than a horse or a boat with sail, but in 1969 the great man was flying the Apollo 10 times at a speed of about 40 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human beings were more connected to the moon.
Nobody's ever moved faster than the Fort 10, and the most disquigententententable optimism about the power of technology, because the big problems we've been hoping to solve with technology, for example, to fly to Mars, to produce clean energy, to cure cancer, or to remove hunger from the world, is not sufficiently difficult.
I remember it as a five-year-old age.
The Apollo 17ths, and my mother was very upset with me not to look in the very dry,paste of Saturn's rocket pack.
I had an idea that this would be the last moon's take, but I was sure that there would be a hundred percent in my life of the planet Mars.
The objection of something happened to our ability to solve big problems with technology is already a flat-lown.
You hear it everywhere.
We've heard it here in TED in the last two days.
It's a thought that technical biologists would have been distracted and saved themselves with no-contacted toys, with things like iPhone and apps and social media, or algorithms that accelerate automated business.
It's not a good thing to do with most of these things.
They've extended our lives and enriched us.
but they're not solving the big problems of humanity.
So what happened?
There's a more sophisticated explanation from Silicon Valley, where you can admit that in recent years, less ambitious companies have been sponsored than Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.
In Silicon Valley, the markets are worth guilty, in the end, the lawyers, the risk lawyers offer to the companies.
Silicon Valley says that risk investors have moved away from supporting world-changing ideas, and instead they're encouraging growing or even invented problems.
But this is not a statement that's not good enough to me.
It's mainly explaining what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
Even in their risk-of-the-day investment, low-income facilities, low-income investment with a demand for a decade.
Now, investors have always been struggling to invest more profitable in technologies like energy, which require an enormous amount of personal capital, and whose development is long-term and unconditional, and the risk-in-enhancing investment never financed the development of technologies that solve huge problems without immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve a big problem are complicated and profound.
Sometimes we're trying to identify the big problems, not the problem.
We could fly to Mars if we want.
NASA actually designed a plan.
But to Mars, a political choice would be about public popularity, and that's why it's never going to happen.
We're not going to fly to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things on Earth that need to be done.
Another time, we can't solve the big problems, because our political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the energy consumption of the Earth is concentrated, renewables, like solar, wind and biofuels, less than two percent, and the reason for that is economically.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than biofuels.
We all want alternative sources of energy that can be enough to keep it, but there's no existing system.
Now, it's that developers, business leaders and economists are basically all thinking about the same thing that national practices and international treaty would advance the development of alternative energy: the main growth in research and development technologies and increased carbon emissions.
But in the current political climate, there is no hope that the energy policy of the United States or the international agreement will be retold and closing the challenges.
Sometimes deep problems have been thought to be technically solvable, but not so.
It's been thought for a long time that hunger would be the failure of food security.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famine is a political crisis that has catastrophic impact on food distribution.
Technology can improve things like harves and systems like warehouses and transport from food, but there will be famine as long as there's no shortage of governance.
And eventually, big problems sometimes are drawn out because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war in 1971, but what he found was, soon, there are many species of cancer that are resilient for the most sophisticated therapy, and only in the last 10 years, effective therapies appear to be real.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems with technology.
We can, we have to, but we have to be able to have these four elements, and that is that the public is concerned, the public is going to be interested in solving a problem, the institutions have to support the solution; it's really a technological problem; and we have to understand it.
And the way the Apollom mission was to solve this sort of metaphor is the ability of technology to solve huge problems, and it filled these criteria.
But this is a model, which in the future can't be repeated.
It's not the year in 1961.
There's no dramatic disconnect, like the Cold War, no politician like John Kennedy, who does all the difficult and dangerous and dangerous to a hero, and no popular science fiction fiction as the study of the solar system.
But most of all, it was just at the end of the moon,
He was only three days away.
And it's debunky whether this really has been a serious problem.
We're wired to ourselves, and the solutions of the future are going to be harder.
God knows, we don't have any challenges at all.
Thank you.
So I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine you're standing in front of your door.
If you look at the door, and you look at the color, and the material that it's made of.
Now, you're going to put a group of overweight FKler on their bicycles.
It's a petroop, and they come right on you and your doorstep.
You have to really imagine that.
They're just flashing, yozing, yozing up and yo-pat on you.
And then they'd all just sit in your doorstep.
Cellcles, wheels, everything goes round, and then you can see the traffic. You can't see if you're in a straight-down space.
Now, you have a standing line above the threshold of your apartment in your closet, your flur or what's on the other side of your apartment, and enjoying how the light bursts in the room.
The light seems to the crumbs on the rippery.
You can get your way off the back of a yellow horse horse.
A man-song horse.
You can almost feel the blue fur, your nose tickls.
You just hold the sixth of the chocolate koke that's rolling into your mouth.
Walk the phone on the side of him, over in your living room.
Here's the whole performance of the performance of Britney Spears.
They only cover their clothes, and they sing "Hit Me More Time," as they danced on your living room.
Now follow me in your kitchen.
The ground was replaced by a yellow Bandway, and out of your oven comes in, Dorothy, the Zinnman, bird cries and the lion of "The Magic of Oz" in the hand, in hand, hop to you.
Okay. Now open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarre competition held every year in New York City spring.
It's called "Inular States Memory Championship."
A few years ago, I wanted to report this competition as a science journalist, and I expected the day anniversary of the island.
It was a bunch of guys, and a few ladies, a few different age, and hygienic retirement.
They were, in fact, hundreds of random numbers, according to each other.
They were interested in using dozens and dozens and dozens of unknown unknown people.
And they were always experiencing poetry in a matter of a few minutes.
They competing for who could visualize the order of a mixed maps at the fastest possible.
That's crazy.
These people have to have supernatural abilities.
I started talking to some of them.
This is Ed Cook, a guy who came out of England, and one of the best-selling events was there.
And I asked him, "Well, when did you realize you've got this special desire?"
And Ed said, "I'm not an island player.
I only have an average memory.
Anyone who's here, who's standing up here will tell you that he or she has only a regular memory.
We've all trained by anthropologists, training, training these incredible memory works, techniques that invented the Greeks two and a half years ago, the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize his speaking, and using medieval scholars to memorize all sorts of books."
And I was like, "Wow, how come you know, I've never heard of it?"
We were outside the competition and Ed, this wonderful, brilliant, and something that was in an ultra-centric English type, said to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.
Do you want a lot of Britishbuil Spears?"
I said, "What? All right. Why?"
I'd like to teach Britney Spears to learn how to memorize the order of a mixed maps. In the U.S. TV.
It would prove that everyone can do this."
I told him, "I'm not British Spears, but you could teach me.
I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And a lot of the next year, I've spent not only time training my memory, but also studying it, understanding how it works, why it sometimes doesn't work, and what might be his potential.
I've met a lot of really interesting people.
So this is E.P.
It's suffering under memory loss, and it's probably the worst memory in the world.
And memory is so bad that he doesn't even remember the memory problem, which is amazing.
Even though it was tragic, he showed a glimpse of how much memory does to us who we are.
On the other hand, I learned.
See Kim Peek.
He was the preference for Dustin Hoffmans' character in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent a afternoon learning in the public library in Salt Lake City's phone books. Just fascinating.
And I came back to read a whole bunch of papers about memory, papers, papers, that were written two thousand years ago, and more in Latin, and later in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting things.
I was especially fascinated that there was a time to actually re-invent the idea of training memory, to disciplinize, to culture, not nearly as foreign as we were today.
There was a time when people invested in their memory, and it was consistent.
Over the last few millennia, we've invented a number of technologies -- the alphabet of the alphabet, the code, the print, the photography, the computer, the smartphone -- that we've made it ever simpler to use our memory to optimize this fundamental human ability.
These technologies have enabled our modern world, but we're also changing.
They changed us culturally, and I would argue that they've also transformed us cognitively.
Without remembering the need, sometimes it seems like we'd forgotten how to do that.
One of the last places in the world, where you can still find people who are still passionate about training their memory, disciplinary, cultured, is this unique memory competition.
In fact, it's not as unique, there are lines of war like this all over the world.
And that made me cry in the closann, I wanted to know how these people do it.
A few years ago, a group at the University of London brought a group of memories and backed back to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is the structure or anatomy of their brains different from the rest of us?
And the answer was no.
Are they smarter than us?
They gave them a stack of cognitive preconceived tests, and the answer was, no, actually.
But there was an interesting and much more telling the difference between the brain of a memory priest and the control person compared to it.
And if you put them in an fMRI machine, and you scan your brain as they're tracking numbers, faces, images of snowflakes, you can see that in the memory of other regions of the brain are illuminating in the rest of us.
It seems like they're using the part of their memory that's used for spatial or navigation.
Why? And we can learn something from that.
The competition for memory is dominated by a kind of competition where anyone every year has a new technology that's rapidly-fipped out of the other facts and needs to catch the rest of the field.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three-day memory champions.
On the desk before him, 36 mixed cards that he's within an hour with a technology he invented and had a singular and unnamed.
He used a similar technology to look at the order of four to 140 random senits in half an hour.
Yes.
And although there's a lot of techniques to be used in this competition for various things, all of these techniques are based on the idea that psychologists call "dragom collaboration."
So the so-called baker-badoxic really illustrates this concept of elegant. It's the following: If I ask two people to remember the same word, and I say, "Look, I tell you there's a person called the baker."
That's his name.
And you tell me, "Look, there's a person who's a baker."
Now, when I come back to you one more later, and I say, "You know the word I told you about a while ago?
Do you know what word it was?"
The person who's supposed to remember the baker is less likely to remember the word than the person who should remember the baker deal.
Same word, different memory capacity; that's weird.
So what's going on here?
Well, the name baker means nothing to you.
It's absolutely independent of all the vintage that's going on in your head that's going to vibrate.
But the guy's job of the bakery, we know baker.
So baker carries weird white hullers.
So bakers have flour on their hands.
So baker smells good when they come home from work.
We know, even a baker,
And when we first hear the word first, we connect that associations with the word and allow it to find the memory more easily.
The secret of what's going on in the memory fights, and the secret to remember how everyday things can be better, is to find a way to turn the name baker into the job store -- an information that has no association, no meaning, in a way, and to change meaning, and to have meaning in all of the containing and complete connection with all of the contiles.
One of the most sophisticated techniques for this can be replicated two and a half years later on the ancient Greeks.
It's known as the memory palace.
The story of its creation goes like this: there was a poet named Simonides who visited a feat.
He was in charge of the conversation, because at the time, if you wanted to kick a really big party, you didn't have a du.J., it was a poet.
He's wearing his poem out of memory and leaves the space, and right at the moment the hall bursts behind him and congratulate all the guests.
Not only are all dead, but their bodies are too much remnessable.
Nobody can tell who's been there, nobody knows where to care.
The body cannot be properly allowed.
It's a tragedy after the other.
Simonides is out there, the only thing that he had to survive, and he closes his eyes, and suddenly he realizes that he can see in front of his inner eye, which is where he was sitting.
And so he takes the remaining in the hand, and takes it through the rubble to the deceased.
And at that moment, Simonides understood something that we all intuitively all know, that we don't know how bad we, how bad we, we know names, telephone numbers, or whether we hear any clues from our colleagues, we have a very good visual and spatial memory.
If I asked you to repeat the first 10 words of the story about Simonides, you would find it difficult.
But I bet if I was asked to remind you who, at that moment, you're sitting on a line of yellow horses in your Foyer, you could visualize it the right thing.
The idea of memory palm is to build a building in the inner eye, and fill it with images of the remembered things -- the crazier, the more weird, the weird, the filer, the picture, to keep it in the memory.
This is a advice that goes back from the ages of over 2,000 years of old Latin,
So how does it work?
So imagine if you're invited to talk at TED, and you want to keep it out of memory, just like Cicero, he would have done it, he would have been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
You could do this: imagine yourself in front of your door.
Imagine a complete crazy and twisted story with no distinctive images to remind you that you'd first want to talk about this crazy competition.
And then you walk into your house, and the ponynament on the back of Mr. Ed.
And that would remind you of introducing your friend Ed Cook.
And if you see Britney Spears, remember a funny anecdote that you wanted to tell.
You go to your kitchen, and the fourth thing you wanted to talk about was this weird journey that you went for a year, and you have some friends who help you remember it.
And so Roman speakers noticed, not for word words, but it was just confused, it was about subject.
The English term "topicame," which is the subject of describing, comes from the Greek word "topos," which means "manet"
These are remains of it when people thought about language and rhetoric in spatial terms.
The kind of version "an first point" is, "For first, you're in your memory paroch."
I found all this just fascinating and still am.
Another round of memory fights.
I wanted to write a little bit about this subculture of competent awe.
But there was a problem.
The problem is that the memory crumbs are dead-day events.
It's like a group of people sitting there and writing a test.
It's kind of exciting when someone's got the rops.
I'm a journalist, I need something worth writing.
I know that the staggering things happen in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to it.
So when I wanted to tell this story, I had to put myself in their shoes.
And so I started to think, every morning, 15 to 20 minutes before I was sitting with my newspaper, to memorize anything.
It may be a poem,
I bought the name from an old yearbook that I bought on the Floh market.
And I had to tell you that it's just going to be amazing, it's going to be a lot of fun.
I could never imagine that.
It's fun because it's not about training memory.
You'd always want to get better and better at doing this, these crazy, colorful, dirty, fun, and hopefully to dream the most unchigable image in front of your inner eye.
I was saving myself in that.
This is me with my standard memory competition training.
A pair of pots and a protective pill, which was covered to two small stripes, because distraction is the largest enemy of the memory gunfower.
I went to the same competition that I once visited a year ago.
and I was sitting in silence, just as an journalist experiment.
It could be a nice epilog for my research.
The problem was that the experiment wasn't planned for you.
I won the competition, which was really not supposed to have happened.
It was nice to be able to talk and give phone numbers and shopping lists, but that wasn't what I wanted to do.
These are just tricks.
And the tricks that work because they're building on some simple ideas about how our brain works.
You don't have to build memory palms or a card reader and you have to know how you can use your memory work.
We often talk about people with a good memory, as though it's a special desire, but that's not true.
Good events are trained.
We're better at rejecting things when we're looking.
We remember when we're engaged.
We remember when we have the opportunity to figure out why information and experience are meaningful for us, why they have meaning and arrange it, if we can convert it into something that makes sense in our own mind-making terms, if we can turn the name "boke" into the job.
The memory palace, these memory techniques, they're all just shortcuts.
In fact, it's not really short-cuts.
They work because they force us to work.
You force us to process and be alert in a way that we don't normally do.
But it's not shortcuts.
And so things are being embedded in memory.
One of the things I want to leave you with is something I remember from E.P., the man who didn't even remember the memory problem, I learned, and our lives are the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose our little life in a moment, to look at our BlackBerry or our iPhone instead of paying attention to people who talk to us? How much we're willing to lose because we're so lazy that we don't want to take a deep breath and remember.
I've learned that memory, in each of us, has incredible capacity.
If we want to live a life of adventure, we need to be the person who doesn't forget.
Thank you.
At the age of 27, I left a very hard job in corporate education for a more challenging job: to be a job.
In New York, I was teaching math for you guys in high school.
Like all teachers, I did tests and exams.
I gave homeworks up.
When the work came back, I calculated grades.
And that wasn't the only difference between the best and the worst students.
I've had some of my most strong students, and I've done it in aerodynamic terms.
Some of my smartest children don't quite cut very well.
And that made me think.
And what you learn in the seventh year of math is that national numbers, decibrutz, the area of a parallel poster.
No, it's not possible that these concepts are not, and I was convinced that all of my students could learn the stuff when they worked long and hard enough.
So after a few years of school, I came to the conclusion that in education, we were able to understand a much better understanding for students and learning from a perspective of motivation, from a psychological perspective.
What we can measure in education is best the I.<unk>. But what if you were to go to school and to live on a lot more, rather than the ability to learn quickly and easily?
So I left the classroom and I made a research school to a psychologist.
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of ultra-pred-drivential situation, and I always wondered who's successful and why?
My research teacher and I went to the West Point Militrakian Academy.
We were trying to predict which kettles would remain in the troops's training, and which ones don't.
We went to the national book competition, and we tried to predict what kids would get out of the most.
We looked at young teachers working in very difficult housing, asking what teacher would teach at the end of the year of the year, and what would their students do most effectively in their students' learning.
We collaborated with private companies, and we asked, what kind of salesmen keep their jobs?
and who would make the most money.
In all these different contexts, there was a property as a significant sign of success.
We weren't conscious of social intelligence.
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't me.
It was in the perseverance.
And persistence is passion and persistence for very long-term targets.
The persistence is persistence.
The perseverance is, if you think about a plan for the future, not just for a week or a month, but for years, and really work hard to make this plan work.
The persistence is life as a marathon, not a sprint.
I started teaching in public school a while ago in Chicago's resignation.
I asked thousands of students about the lower-grade school gap to the pervance, and then waited for a year to see who did the degree.
It turns out that kids with higher persistence achieve more likely the degree, even if I could take all the possible measures, things like family income, results at standardized tests, even certainly felt safe in school.
So with adversity, it's not just in Westris, and in the book competition, but it's also in school, especially for children with a lagging risk.
And the most amazing thing about this issue, to me, is that we know so little that science knows so little about how to build it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we support the perseverance of children?"
How do I teach kids how to do a solid work ethic?
How do I make it motivated for distance processes?"
The honest answer: I don't know.
But what I know is that you don't have any talent whatsoever.
Our data is understanding that a lot of talented people don't just remain true.
In fact, the perseverance of our understanding is not professional, but it's actually correlated with talent.
As far as the best idea I've heard about the growing resilience of the intermediate, is what we call the growth-based attitude.
And this idea was developed at Stanford University of Carol Dweck, and it includes the belief that the ability to learn is not determined, but that they can change themselves with your application.
Dr. Dweck has shown that kids, when they read about the brain and learn how it's changing in response to challenges and growing, failure is much more likely to retain, because they don't believe that failure is permanent.
This growth-based posture is a great idea for building resilience.
But we need more.
So here's what I want to end with, and that's where we're already there.
That's the work that's on us.
We need to keep our best ideas and test the most powerful intolerments.
We have to measure whether we were successful. We have to be willing to fail, to fight, to learn, to learn, and to start from scratch.
In other words, we need more persistence in our children than we need more perseverance.
Thank you.
So in my own work, the connection between overcoming our community and part of the environment is to be in which architecture is growing out of the natural, local conditions, and traditions.
I've brought a little example of this today, and I've brought some current projects.
And both of these projects are in the emerging economies, one in Ethiopia, and one of my Tunisia.
And they also have the same kind of analysis that the various different perspectives will become a much more substantial part of the supernatural architecture.
The first example, one of the first, one invitation, was to design a more-story mall in Ethiopia's capital of Addis Abba.
This is the kind of buildings that we were being shown to us, my team and me, as an example of what we should design.
At first, I thought I wanted to go shopping.
After we saw some of these buildings -- there are many of them in the city -- we realized they have three essential features.
First, these buildings are nearly empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, they need a lot of energy because the surfaces are made out of glass, which is what heat inside, and then you need a lot of refrigeration.
In a city where this shouldn't happen, because they have pretty mild weather, which is between 20 to 25 degrees.
And third, their image has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a place where there's such rich culture and tradition.
And I was really fascinated with this old market, and I was obsessed with the old-greened market, where thousands of people go and buy and buy, every day with little collaborators.
It also has this idea of public space that uses the outside area to create activity.
So I thought, this is exactly what I really want to design, not a shopping mall.
But the question was how we could design a more small, contemporary building with these principles.
The next challenge came when we looked at the property, because it's in a real growing area in the city where most of the buildings you see on the slide were not there yet.
And it's also between two parallels, which have no connection with hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was we created a connection between these two streets, and we put all the input in the building there.
And it's going to keep on a common atrium that creates a free air space in the building that's protecting itself from its own shape, from the sun and the rain.
And to this small, we placed the idea of a marketplace with little stores that change in every floor because of the form of the chambanity.
I also thought, how do we close the building?
I really wanted to find a solution that responds to local climate change.
I started thinking about textiles, like a bowl of concrete with perforation, which would let the air go, and light, but in filtered form.
And then I started to inspire these beautiful buttons in the clothing of Ethiopian women.
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and that helped me to create the entire facade.
We're building this with these little preconprosights, the windows, the air, the light in a way, to the building controlled,
And this is being punched through these little colored blues that are using light from the building to light the building at night.
It was not just the beginning of convincing the developer with these ideas, because they thought, "That's not a shopping mall. We haven't ordered that."
But then we've all realized that this idea of the marketplace is much more profitable than the idea of a shopping mall because they can basically sell more stores.
The idea of the facade was much, much less expensive, not just because of the material compared to glass, but because we didn't need air conditioning anymore.
So we created some cost savings that we used to do to make the project happen.
The first was thinking about how we could make the building energy-saving, in a city that has nearly every day of electricity.
We created a precious contribution by adding solar panels on the roof.
We were imagining the roof as a new public space with trump and bars that create this urban oasis.
These barches on the rooftop collect the water to the reuse of sanitation.
Hopefully, at the beginning of the next year, because we've already completed the construction until the fifth floor.
The second example is a master's plan for 2,000 apartments and institutions in Tunis.
And to do this as a large project, the biggest project I've ever designed, I really had to understand the city of Tunis, but also the environment, the tradition and the culture.
And during this analysis, I was particularly interested in the medina, which is 1,000-year-old, old structure that was suspended from a wall, accessible by 12 toreters, and was made up of almost straight lines.
When I was sitting on the site, the first step was to prolong the existing streets to create the first 12 blocks of blocks, with similar sizes and properties like the one in Barcelona and in other European cities.
In addition, we chose some strategic dots in the idea of these tors and connected them to straight lines, and that changed the original pattern.
The last step was thinking about the cell, the little cell of the project, like the apartment, as a central part of the master's career.
What would be the best alignment in a dormant climate for a apartment?
This is North- Jewish, because of the temperature-songing background between the two house pages that are created and creating natural ventilation.
So we put a pattern on this that will make sure that most apartments are perfectly aligned in this direction.
And that's the result, it's almost like a combination of European blocks and the Arab region.
There are blocks of rain and floods in the ground, and there are all these connections for pedestrian pedestrian spaces.
It also fits the local regulations that are more dense in the upper floor, and a lower density in the soil.
It also enhances the idea of the tore.
The volume has this constellar form that's allowed itself to take through three different rooms, and also to reach in very dense, four-legged light into the soil. In the courtyards, there are three different institutions, like a gymacity and a kindergarten, and in a sub-collo-collo-collite set of business that takes activity in the soil.
The rooftop, my favorite place in this project, is that the community is almost back to the space that's taken from the building.
And all the neighbors can go up and come together and do things like a two-mile drive in the morning, from one building to the other.
And these two examples have a common approach to the design process.
They're in emerging economies where you can literally see cities grow.
In these cities, the effect of architecture in today and future life changes people's local communities and economies are growing as fast as the buildings are growing.
And for that reason, I find it more important that architecture is seeking simple, but affordable solutions that are reinforcing the relationship between the community and the environment that are focused on connecting nature and humans.
Thank you.
I want to talk about trust, and I want to remind you about the conventional beliefs about trust.
They're so ubiquitous that they've become the stereotype.
And this is what I think is three of these.
First, trust is very high in decline, many believe.
And then there's a goal: We should trust more.
And one task: We should rebuild the trust.
I believe that the claim is the goal and the task based on false ideas.
I want to tell you a different story about a claim, a goal, and a task that will give a much better approach to the cause.
Well, the very claim is, why do people think that trust has come back?
And if I really think about this with my current knowledge, I don't know the answer.
Maybe it took off or taken it into some of the activities or institutions that might have been done in others.
I'm missing what I'm talking about.
But of course, I can look at the surveys that are supposedly the source of faith that the trust has come back.
So if you look at opinion issues over time, there's not much evidence for it.
So people who were around 20 years ago will be suspicious, mainly journalists and politicians, still being disastrous.
And the people who are very familiar with this, 20 years ago, will still be very familiar: the judges, the nurses.
We're in the middle of the street. And by the way, the average citizens are almost exactly the same in the middle.
But is that a good sign?
Regategies like this, obviously -- opinions.
What else could they stand up?
So they're looking at the general mindset of people when they're asked certain questions.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
Now, if you asked someone, do you trust me with the veg?
You trust fish traffickers?
Do you trust the first school teachers?
So, you might ask, "What exactly?"
And that would be a sensible response.
And if you understand the answer to it, you might say, "I trust some of them, but some of them don't."
All right.
In short, we're trying to bring faith in different ways, in our short lives.
We don't think of it either that we trust every official or an official or institutional institution.
So for example, I could say that I'd rather trusted a lot of my peers' school teacher to teach me the first class to read, but I wouldn't let her ride the school bus.
I know if I happen to know she's not driving well.
I strongly trust that my sightery friend's conversation is going on, but maybe not so sure that they're a secret.
Simple.
So we know from our everyday lives how trust might look different, but why don't we know this knowledge when we're thinking abstract about trust?
Now, polls here are very, very bad at arguing about the actual trust level, because they ignore the common common common common common sense that you use in trust.
Secondly, we're going to move to the goal.
The goal is to trust more.
And I think, to be stupid, that's what I think is the target.
I wouldn't vote on that.
I would try to trust the trustworthy more, the trustworthy, but not.
I even tried to not trust trust trust.
And the people who, for example, put their savings in the hands of a certain Mr. Madoff, who then, as the name of it, made it from the dust, slam <unk> <unk> <unk>"ding<unk> <unk> <unk>"hooo, I think, I'm thinking, too much trust.
"Fear trust" is not a smart target in this life.
Heightened trust and too much should have been the goal.
And then you say, yes, okay, so what's most important is not trust, but trust, but trustworth.
The trustworthiness of people.
And to do that, we need to look at three things.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
If we find a person in the right topics competent, reliable and honest, then we have a good reason to trust them, then it's trustworthy.
but the person is meaningless, it's probably not.
Some of my friends are competent and honestly, I wouldn't let them send a letter, because they're dreadful.
I have friends who trust very well in their own competence, but they overestimate a lot.
And I'm very happy to think that I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and reliable but nonetheless.
If I did, I didn't realize it.
But after that, let's look for trustworthiness, then trust.
And trust is the reaction.
And of course, trustworthiness is hard.
Over the past decades, we've been trying to set control systems in all sorts of institutions and experts and in voice users that make it easier for us to estimate their trustworthiness.
Many of these systems have the opposite effect.
They don't work like re-directed.
A mid-drew once said to me, "The problem is that the paper paper paper paper would take longer than the baby is hitting the world."
Now, all of our public life, in our institutions, this problem is affecting this problem. It's this problem. It's called the control system to make trustworthiness and credibility, but it leads to the contrary.
It's humanding people like Hebids who are struggling with their difficult tasks by putting a napkin on the first time.
Now, I'm sure there's any example of this.
So that's what it's going to be.
The goal is more trustworth, and it's going to be difficult if we want to be trusted and communicate with others, and if we want to think about whether other people, whether or whether or whether or official or politicians are trustworthy.
It's not easy. You have to judge it. Simple reactions or attitudes don't get rich.
And now we're going to do the job.
By describing the practice of trust, it's revived the issue.
Because it suggests that you should rebuild and trust.
We can do that for ourselves, of course.
We can make a little bit of trustworthiness.
And so two people can actually improve their trust.
But ultimately, trust is characterized by others.
You can't rebuild the thing others give.
You have to give them a foundation that they trust you.
So you have to be trusted.
And of course, this is because you don't usually have to put all the people around the nose at the same time.
But you also need to have evidence that you are trustworthy.
How do we do that?
This is happening every day, everywhere. Normal people do, officials, people who are, really, really effective.
So here's a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks, they'll take me back and they'll not ask me questions.
They take it back and give me the money, or some of the socks that you wish the paint.
That's great. I trust them because they showed me vulnerable.
And there's a big moral part of this.
When you stand up close to the other, it's a very good indication that you are trustworthy and that you're relieved your own words.
So our goal is, in principle, not very hard to see.
They are relationships between trusted people, and the guessability is when and whether the other one is trustworthy.
So the moral of history is thinking much less about trust, or thinking about attitudes about trust, finding questions correctly or correct in re-corruption, and much more about trustworthiness, and how you bring people adequate, useful evidence of your own faithworth.
Thank you.
You know, the best thing about the father's father's father is the films I can see.
I love to look at my own favorite films with my kids, and when my daughter was four years old, we sat together with the "The Magic of Oz."
And the movie didn't leave it for months.
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.
So she had a good excuse to wear a vimply-lipped dress and a magic sticker.
But if you look at this film a lot, you can see how extraordinary it is.
We live in the modern world today, and our children are moving in a kind of spectacular, iconic, industrial arop.
But "The Magicer of Oz was different.
He didn't start this trend.
It took 40 years to get through this trend, with a little bit of a little, interesting -- a different film where a guy had rescued a little bit of metal and a guy with a lot of a furs, and she was pounding like the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about, right?
Right.
Now, there's a big difference between these two films, and there are several different differences between the "The Magic of Oz" and all the films that we're looking at today.
First of all, there's a lot of violence in the Magic Oz.
The monkeys are quite aggressive, just like the apple trees.
But I think, if the magic of Oz was produced today, the magician would have said, "Dorothy, you're the Retterin of Oz who was once deflected.
Call your magic shoes to beat the computers of evil Hexees of the West."
That's not how it happens.
The other point I find in the "Dssery of Oz" is that the heroic and brightest and even impacted characters are female.
This is the first time I noticed when I showed my daughter "Star Wars," what years later was, and the situation was different.
And at that point, I had a son too.
He was only three years old at the time.
He wasn't invited to this cinema evening. He was too young for that.
But he was the second child, and he was much less assured than his sister.
So he's hacking in, and he's looked at the movie, and he's going to look like a duck, and his mother's going to be watching a crack, and I don't think he's got a handle on what's going on, but he's definitely in his face.
And I was thinking, what's he going on?
Did he realize it's about courage, persistence and loyalty?
Did he realize that Luke joined an army to overcoming the government?
Did he realize that there are only boys in the universe, out of aunt Beru, and of course the princess, who's really cool, but most of the time, it's really waiting for the heroes to reward a medo and a eyeache to thank him for the rescue of the universe, which he did, thanks to the magic he was born?
Compare this with the Magic Beer of Oz" in 1939.
How does Dorothy bring her film to a good ending?
And they're all formed and a leader.
This is the kind of world where I would rather prefer my children -- Oz, right? -- and not in the world where guys fight with each other, which is kind of what our world today.
Why is there so much power -- big, power -- in the movies that are available for our children, and so few yellow brick routes?
There's a lot of good literature about the impact that movies have on girls on their own side of violent boys, and they should read. They're very good.
But I didn't read so much about how boys deal with that effect.
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not give the right-sense model that I could have used to find the world through the adult world where girls and boys are taught together.
I think there was this moment with the first kiss, when I really expected that the diver was going, because that's what a movie ends like, right?
I finished my mission. I got the girl.
Why are you still sitting there?
I don't know what to do.
The films are very much about fighting the evil and catching their reward, and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other travel.
It almost acts as if you're a guy, a nasty animal, and if you're a girl, you should be able to bring your warmen back.
There are many exceptions to this, and I'm going to defend the Disney Basin process from everybody else.
But they give a message to the boys, and the boys are not really the goal.
They're marvelous at teaching girls how to stop the patriarchy, but they don't necessarily show the boy how to fight against the patriarch.
There's no role models for them.
There are also some grandiose women who write new stories for our children, and they're so three-dimensional, and wonderful Hermine and Katniss, they're still war movies.
And of course, the most successful studio of all time produces a class of classical after the other, and each of them is about the journey of a boy or a man, or two men, who are friends, or a man, or a man, or his son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Up until -- as many of you think it safe, this year, after the end of the movie, they came out of "Merida" -- legend of the highlight.
I recommend it to all of you. It's on the Internet.
Do you remember what the Critic said when "Merida" came out?
"Oh, I can't believe that Pixar did a princess film."
He's very good. Don't let it go from that.
But no good as any of these films have passed the test for the Bechdel.
I don't know if you've heard about it.
He hasn't really taken it properly, and he's kind of a little bit of a good job of it, but we're going to start a movement today.
Alison Bechdel is a book book writer, and in the middle of the '80s, she took this conversation that she had with a friend about the review of the films that she had seen.
It's very simple. There are only three questions to ask: Is there more than one character in the movie, the female is and saying something?
Try to fulfill this premise.
And do these women speak to each point of the movie?
And is it all about something else in their conversation than the guy they like in their own conversation?
You? Thank you.
Thank you.
Two women that exist and talk to each other about anything.
Something like this. I've seen it. And yet, I rarely see it in the movies we know and love.
In fact, I went to the cinema this week to see a very good movie, "Argo."
You remember? A lot of hype on the Oscars, great players, a common match about what a good Hollywood movie is.
It's falling through the Bechdel's test.
I think it shouldn't, because a lot of the movie -- I don't know if you saw it -- but a lot of the movie plays in a message where men and women hide during the delus.
There are some good scenes where men in this hiding hiding, they're terrified, and the big moment that one of the actors has been to look in and go to the door and say, "Come to bed, honey?"
So some of you think Hollywood is like this.
So let's take a look at the numbers.
In 2011, under the 100 most popular films, you think, how many of them have actually had female women's chief characters?
Elf. It's not a bad thing.
It's not as many proves as the number of women we just picked in Congress, so that's good.
But there's a number that's bigger than that, and that's getting caught in this space.
Last year, the New York Times published a study that government did.
It's said.
One out of five women in the U.S. is that she was already sexually assured in her lifetime.
I don't think it's the fault of general entertainment.
I don't think kids have anything to do with it.
I don't think that music videos and pornography are right on the subject, but something goes wrong, and when I hear this statistic, one of the things I think is a lot of sexual sexual partners.
Who are these guys? What do they learn?
What are they not going to learn?
Do they have a story in your mind that it's the job of a male heroes to beat the spell with violence and then pick up the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't talk?
So let's take this story like this?
You know, as a parent, who's the privilege of taking a daughter, just like those of you who do the same thing, we find this world, and we find this statistics very alarming, and we want to prepare them.
We have tools like "cirlpower," and we hope that will help, but I also wonder whether girls will protect them when we do it at the same time, active or passive, our sons to keep their fortune.
So the Netflix geeks are a means of something that we can do very important with, and I'm talking to the fathers here.
I think we have to just give our sons a new definition of masculinity.
The definition of manhood is already about changing.
They've read New Economy's performance change the roles of housewife and killing fees.
They're being messed up.
Our sons will find a way to adapt, to a new relationship with one another, and I think we really need to show them that a real man who is trusting his sisters and respectes them, and who are standing on the side and who are really the evil guys, who are the men who want to abuse.
I think we should look for the Netflix maps on movies that make the Bechdel Test, if we can find them, and look for the heroes that are there, the real mutants that bring people together and bring our sons to identify with them, and say, "I want to stand on your side because they're on the side, because they're on their side.
When I asked my daughter who was her favorite character in "Star Wars", you know what she said?
It's Obi-Wan.
It's Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What do these two have in common?
Maybe it's not just the sheer dress.
I think these two figures are experts.
These are the two characters in the movie who know more than everyone else, and they love to share their knowledge with other people, to help them escape their potential.
And they're also leaders.
I like this kind of task for my daughter, and I like this kind of thing for my son.
I want more tasks like this.
I want to make less tasks in my son, where my son is told, "Tieh, go out and shake, and more tasks that he should join a team, maybe a team that's led by a woman to help others become better people, and to be better people, like the wizard of Oz.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about the story of a small-city kid.
I don't know what his name is, but his story is.
He lives in a small village in the South Bronx.
His village is near Mogadicu.
The drought caused the poverty in this village and the dying of dying.
When there was nothing there that he was holding, he left his village, and he went to town, in this case, Mogadian, the capital of Somalias.
When it comes, there's no possibility, no work, no way out.
At the end, he comes in a tent camp outside Mogadicu.
It may go a year, but nothing.
And one day, he's approached by a man who's visiting him for lunch, then for dinner, after breakfast.
He meets this dynamic group of young people, and she gives him a chance.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes and send money home to his family.
and it's presented to this young woman.
He finally married.
He's starting a new life.
His life has meaning.
On a nice day in Mogadicu, under the heatless sky, a car bomb goes into the air.
This is a small-scale urban living room that was self-famous and solders, and this dynamic group of young people was al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization with connections to al <unk>aeda.
And how could the story of a small-city kid just trying to get in the city of the city and end up saying that he was going to blow himself up?
He was waiting for him.
He had waited for a chance to go out for the future, and it was the first chance he offered him.
It was the first thing that he got out of a state that we call "Waithood."
And his story repeats over and over again in the urban areas around the world.
It's the story of the rights that's unleashed, unemployed urban youth, that's caused in Johannesburg and London's open, and it's partly as if something else is called "Waithood."
Young people promise about the city, their large-scale spaces, opportunities, wealth, but young people have no obligations to the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's the youth who's under-performing unemployment.
In 2030, three out of five people in the cities will be younger than 18 years old.
If we don't include young people in the growth of cities, if we don't have any opportunity, then we will turn "Waithood," which is the one that changes in terrorism, in the violence and in gangs, the cities are the ones that are going to be in 2000.
In my birth, Mogadicu, 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.
Seventy percent have no jobs, not going to school.
They're not actually doing anything at all.
Last month, I went back to Mogadianu, and I went to Madina Hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of this little bag, and thinking, what if I hadn't been here, I remember?
What if I had been forced to the same state of "Waithood."
If I had become a terrorist?
I'm not sure what to say.
The reason for me this month in Mogadicu was actually the alignment of a gipler for young leaders and entrepreneurs.
I brought together about 90 young leaders.
We sat down and we made brainstorming to solutions for the biggest challenges in their city.
There was a young man, a seead.
He went to the university in Mogadicu, and he graduated there.
There was no work, no possibility.
I remember telling me that he was a university degree, a college degree, practicing, frustrated, who was the perfect goal to be a member of al-Shabaab and other terrorist organizations.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes another run.
In Mogadicu, the biggest obstacles are to get from B to B, the streets.
Twenty-three years of civil war completely destroyed the urban system, so the motorcycle is the best railroad staple.
And as a man realized, the opportunity and she grabbed it.
He opened a motorcycle business.
And he started to rent motor engines to Orts's water that they could not afford otherwise.
With his family and friends, he bought 10 motorbikes, and he was leaving his business eventually, in the next three years, to a few hundred years.
What's the difference between the others?
What makes the difference?
And I think it's his ability to recognize and use a new opportunity.
It's the entrepreneurship, and I believe that entrepreneurship can be the most effective means for the better in "Waithood."
It empowers young people in creating the economic opportunity they're searching so desperately.
You can teach young people how to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was part of my meeting meeting, Muhammad Mohamoud, a creature.
He helped me, the entrepreneurship of a few young people who participate in the top, educating and showing them how to innovate, and how to create entrepreneurs.
He's actually the first fladist who's been watching Mogadicu for 22 years, and until recently, before Muhammad was there, you used artificial utension that came from offshore ship when you wanted flowers on his wedding.
If you asked someone, "When did you see the last fresh flowers?" then the answer was the answer of many who grew up during the Civil War: Never."
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a landscape of wooden bags.
He put a plantation outside of Mogadic, and started growing tulps and las and viles, which he said could survive in the snowlights of Mogadian.
It started to popularize with flowers, rebuilt private gardens and business around the city, and it's working on the design of the first public park in Mogadiku for 22 years.
There's no public parks in Mogadicu.
He wants to create a place where families and young people come together, and he says, "That's the beautiful things that life can enjoy.
Just as it gets out. He doesn't catch any roses because they need too much water.
So the first stage is to inspire young people, and in this room, Mohamed's presence has a huge impact on the other young people in the room.
They'd never really thought about building a company.
They thought they were working for an NGO or for the government, but this story, its innovation, had a strong impact on them.
It confances them to look at their city as a place of possibility.
It confances them in being entrepreneurs, that they can be entrepreneurs, that they could make change.
At the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges in their city.
They had community solutions for local problems.
So the inspiration of young people and the creation of entrepreneurship is a really big step, but young people need capital to actually get their ideas done.
They need expertise and encouragement to come up with them and develop their business and start.
Bring young people with the resources they need, connect, give them the support they need to make ideas happen, and you're going to create catalysts for urban growth.
And for me, entrepreneurship is more than just founding a business.
It's about creating social effects.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
They're called "fassionary" when it's created, the view of people in their city changes.
And so that the street kids have been recruited to help them to quit and maintain their engines.
He gave them the chance to escape from the coldest state of the Waithood.
These young companies have tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, make young people entrepreneurs, advise, and encourage them to innovate, and you'll get more stories about flowers and "to-full" instead of getting car bombings and "Waithood."
Thank you.
And while I was a kid in Maine, one of my favorite exercises was to look for sanddollars in the coastal of Maine because my parents were arguing that that would give happiness.
But there's a lot of hard to find.
They're clogged from sand, not able to see.
But after a certain time, I had developed a routine.
I started looking at shapes, and patterns that helped me to collect them.
And this came up with a passion to find things, to a love of past and archaeology.
And then, when I finally started studying <unk>aedaology, I realized that the vision didn't bounce my eyes back.
And all of a sudden, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine grew up to a kind of odd long distance, along the counter, and my sandline grew up to size of cities.
And that led me to using satellite imagery.
I had to see differently in order to map the past in a map.
So I want to show you how we see, for example, when we use infrared.
This is a site that's located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Mond.
And the site appears to be brown. We use infrared, and we process it with a false color, and suddenly this site is brightly flashing.
What you see here are the chemical changes in the landscape through the tree materials and the infectious of the old Egyptians.
So what I'd like to share with you today is how we used satellite data to find an old, Portuguese city that carries the name of Itj-taui and was handed away for thousands of years.
It's Sj-taui, the U.S. capital of Egypt, for more than four hundred years, in a epochial realm, about four thousand years ago.
The site is in Egyptian al-Fayyum, and it's very significant because in the Middle East there was a great renaissance of old England, architecture and religion.
<unk>aedaologists always knew that the site of the Soj-taui was somewhere near the pyramids, built by the two kings here, shown here with the red circles, but somewhere in this massive sword.
This area is huge -- the area is four miles.
The Nil used to be right away from the Soj-taui, and as his run, the path was changing and moving toward the West, it was covering the city.
So you can find a vertical city in such a smooth landscape.
And you're going to be looking at it, and you're going to find the equivalent of finding the needle in the haystack with close eyes and baseball shoes.
And so NASA's first-born type of blog shows to make a map of the landscape in a way that we could see easily in light changes.
And where the counter was in the first place.
But you can see, and it's very interesting, and this light-specific area, it's sped with the circle that appears to us as a possible position for the city of Itj-tingi.
So we've been working with Egyptian scientists to do the hard-to-distance drilling, which you can see here.
It's like Hulsel's shell in the ice, and it's just the layers of climate change that tells you how to find layers of the human space.
In a depth of five meters, under a thick layer of mud, we found a layer of rotations of clay.
This shows that in this possible position for the Soj-H-taui, in five meters, we can find one in a number of hundred years of living, all the way back to the Middle East, to the original era where we think of the Ottopi.
And we also found worksstone -- Karneol, <unk>u<unk> and Achat -- and what this shows is a jewelry, it's been working here.
Now, this may not look like a lot, but if you look at the most common rocks that were used by jewels in the Middle East, you'll find these rocks.
So we found a slow layer of the local court on this site that was returning to the Middle East.
We also found evidence for a jewelry for the mammoth society, which is to show that this has to be a very important city.
It didn't come out of the place yet, but we're going to go back to this site soon to paint a map.
What's more important is we have funding for young Egyptians who are trained in satellite technology so that they're the ones that can do so long.
And so I wanted to conclude with my favorite heritage from the Middle East -- it was maybe written in the city of Itj-taui a thousand years ago.
"You know, to share, the greatest job job.
There's nothing like that in the country."
And TED was not founded in 1984 B.C.
And it was only in 1984 when ideas started in Delhi, and in one that was not long-lived, but it was discovered in the first place.
You can't do that with the clogepipe at the beach.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I grew up in Taiwan as a daughter of a Kigraph. In my most beautiful memories, like my mother pointed the beauty, the form and the shape of the Chinese character.
And since then, I've been fascinated by this incredible language.
But for an outside line, it seems to be as straightforward as the Great Wall of China.
And I've been wondering, in the last few years, how can I break this wall, so that anyone who has the interest in this complex language has the interest of it, and learn it,
And I thought that a new, rapid way of learning Chinese would be useful.
For the fifth years, I've learned to draw every stick for every copifus in the right sequence.
Over the next 15 years, I learned new typeface sounds every day.
And we've only had five minutes of technology, a faster and simpler way of doing it.
A Chinese scholar understands about 20,000 characters.
They only need 1,000 characters for a simple, simple writing.
The most important 200 allows you to understand 40 percent of the simple literature -- enough to understand and understand the criteria for street maps, and understand the basic of particular websites or newspapers.
So I'm going to start with eight type of letters to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
"Belel your mouth as much as possible until it's square.
And that's what's going to be called a "mund."
This person walks for a walk.
"V"
If the reception of "future" shows a person with high-income arms, as if he was screaming, "Fake me! I'm going to -- the sign is originally caused by the shape of the river, but I like this idea, for example, the ones that you love best.
This is a tree.
"Hool."
This is a bent.
The "Sonne."
The Mond.
The scandal of "Cure" looks like a salo-diction door from the West.
So these eight type characters are radical.
They're the nestway to create a variety of fonts.
A human being.
If there's anyone behind it, it means "pollow."
If you have it, two percent of all, and three people will say "discovery."
If a human could approach his arms out far, this person says, "It was so big."
The human in the mouth, it's locked up.
He's a <unk>Gefarder<unk>, like Jonas in the whale.
A tree is in place for a tree, and two trees are together for a "math."
And three are together for a drum.
You're going to put a plaza under the tree, and you're a basis.
Put a mouth on top of it, it means "idiotic."
Just to remember, because a speaking tree is pretty stupid.
Remember the fire?
Two flames on the outside means "shit."
Three fire adds up many of the corridors.
Put the fire under two trees, it means "tus."
We're wired to the sun.
Two suns are adding "good."
Three of them are "beat."
When the sun seems to be together and the moon, it means fat.
And in contrast, it can also be in the next day.
The sun goes over the horizon: sunrise.
Voice 2: Voiceh. Voiceh. Voice 2: Voiceh. Voiceh: Voicehore. Voiceh. Voicehill is the front door.
You can put a mouth in the door, it means, "Forget."
It's a smell, it's claw. Anyone there?
This person is kind of littering out of the door. "Sake out."
On the left is "wu."
Two women are together for a "flit."
For instance, with three women, this is called "Evation."
We've actually met 30 characters of characters now.
And then, using this method, you can form out of the first eight-degree radical, 32 words.
The next group, with eight characters, is creating another 32 words.
You can learn a little bit of effort, a few hundred characters, like an eight-year-old Chinese kid.
If we can put these typeatures, we start to put them together.
For example, mountain comes together and fire brings the fireberg together, which is a "Vul Desert."
We know Japan is the country on the top of the sun.
This is the sun with the great leap, because Japan is east-down from China.
A sun with the origin of the sun means "Japanese."
A human being behind Japan makes?
"Japaner."
The type of sign on the left is two mountains on the outside.
In the classic Chinese, it means "Exil," because Chinese sociders sent their political enemies into the exile over the mountains.
Today, "Exil" has become a "beep."
A mouth saying where it's going, it's about "to-reason."
This is the slide that reminds me of leaving the stage. Thank you.
